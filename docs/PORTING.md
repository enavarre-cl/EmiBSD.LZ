# Porting process

How a C file becomes a Rust file. The rules Claude follows are in
`.claude/rules/porting-workflow.md`; this is the longer human version plus the status table.

## 1. Pick a file

`cargo xtask ports next` lists `todo` entries whose dependencies are `ported` or `skipped`.
If the file you want is not listed, add it to `ports.toml` as `todo` with its `deps` first.
`docs/ROADMAP.md` says which files belong to the current milestone.

## 2. Read

Read the `.c` completely. Then its header(s). Then the `(9)` man pages it mentions.
Before coding, write down:

- the call graph: what it calls, what calls it;
- locking and SPL assumptions (`splhigh`, `mtx_enter`, `KERNEL_LOCK`, "called at IPL_x");
- every error path and what it returns;
- every `#ifdef` and the `option(4)` behind it;
- data structures it owns versus borrows.

## 3. Header template

Every ported file starts like this (`sys/lib/libkern/strlcpy.rs`). The `$OpenBSD$` line and the
licence block are copied verbatim from the C file; the licence block sits between the
`/* <LICENSES> */` and `/* </LICENSES> */` marker lines. Everything else is inside
`/* <CODE> */` ... `/* </CODE> */`, and the tests, inline, in `/* <TESTS> */` ... `/* </TESTS> */`
at the end (only in files that have tests). `cargo xtask ports check` validates the markers, their
order, that `<LICENSES>` opens with the author's ISC block (before the original notice, or alone)
and `<TESTS>` is only where there is a `mod tests`. A file whose C has several notices keeps all
of them inside one pair of markers, after the author's block and one blank line; a C file with
no licence text gets `license = "none"` on its `ports.toml` entry and the author's block alone. To read a
ported file, read its code zone (`sed -n '/<CODE>/,/<\/CODE>/p' <file>`).

use crate::strnlen;

// ... the port ...
/* </CODE> */

/* <TESTS> */
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    // ... the tests ...
}
/* </TESTS> */
```

## 4. Write

Idiomatic Rust that preserves semantics. `docs/C_TO_RUST.md` is the idiom table; follow it or add
a row. Keep OpenBSD names. Put types in the header's module, functions in the file's module.
When something the file needs is not ported yet, stub it visibly
(`.claude/rules/scope-and-stubs.md`), never silently.

## 5. Test

- Pure logic: an inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in the `<TESTS>` zone of the same file (never
  a `tests.rs`), runs with `just test`.
- Constants mirrored from C headers: `#[ignore]` reference-backed test, runs with `just test-ref`.
- Boot, console, trap behaviour: smoke expectation in `tools/xtask`, runs with `just smoke`.

## 6. Record

In `ports.toml`: `status = "ported"`, `upstream_commit` = `[meta].pinned`,
`upstream_blob` = `git -C reference/openbsd-src rev-parse HEAD:<c path>`, `notes` for stubs.
Then `cargo xtask ports check` and `cargo xtask ports status --write`.

## 7. Commit

`<scope>: port <file>.c (<what>)` with one `Upstream:` trailer per C file.
See `.claude/rules/git-commits.md`.

## Skipping

`status = "skipped"` with `notes` starting with one of `replaced-by-limine`, `provided-by-core`,
`deferred-driver`, `license: <which>`, `not-applicable`, followed by a short reason.
Skipped is a recorded decision, not "later".

## Bumping the reference pin

Deliberate, never automatic:

```sh
git -C reference/openbsd-src fetch --depth 1 origin master
git -C reference/openbsd-src checkout --detach FETCH_HEAD
cargo xtask ports drift --diff      # what changed upstream among ported files
# triage each DRIFT line: re-port, or add a note explaining why the change does not apply
# update reference/PINNED.md (Commit:, Date:) and ports.toml [meta].pinned
git commit -m "reference: bump OpenBSD pin to <12-hex>"
```

## Measuring unsafe

`cargo xtask unsafe-report` (M12+) counts the `unsafe` keywords of the kernel crates (`sys/`,
with `sys/lib/libkern` and `sys/lib/libz`, and `init/`; not `tools/xtask`). It is the Phase 2
baseline ([PHASE2.md](PHASE2.md)); `--write` puts the totals on the `Unsafe` line of
`docs/STATUS.md`.

- What counts: `unsafe { }` blocks, `unsafe fn` declarations (also `unsafe extern "C" fn`),
  `unsafe impl`, `unsafe trait`. "Other" is every remaining `unsafe`: `unsafe extern` blocks,
  `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]` attributes and `unsafe fn(..)` pointer types.
- What does not: an `unsafe` inside a comment, a string or a raw string (a small lexer skips
  them), and `r#unsafe`.
- Test code is a column of its own: the item after a test-only `#[cfg]` (the inline
  `mod tests` of the `<TESTS>` zone), files declared by a test-only `mod` (`testutil.rs`) (`test`, `all(.., test)`; `any(test, feature = "x")`
  also builds into a kernel and counts as kernel code). Moving the tests inline (M15) changed
  no total: only the "tests files" column shrank, to the files a test-only `mod` declares.
- Subsystems: the first directory under `sys/` (`kern`, `uvm`, `net`, `netinet`, `ufs` with
  ffs/mfs/ext2fs, `isofs`, ...); `arch/<a>` and `lib/<l>` by two; `dev/<d>` for the bus and
  chip directories that hold a `mod.rs` (`pci`, `pv`, `ic`, `isa`, `fdt`, `ofw`, `efi`), and
  `dev` for the rest of `sys/dev` (softraid, vnd, rd, bio, cons, rnd); `sys/*.rs` is
  `(crate root)`. `arch/host` is the `cargo test` double, counted as code.
