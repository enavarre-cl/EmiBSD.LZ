/* <CODE> */
//! M13's QEMU device options, and the disk images they attach (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
//! "Parallel smokes" for where the files go).
//!
//! - `--nvme FILE` (`qemu`, `smoke`): an NVM Express controller (`-device nvme`, nvme(4))
//!   whose one namespace is the raw image FILE (a relative path is in the run directory,
//!   [`boot::run_dir`]). On amd64 it sits on `q35`'s PCI bus, added right after the NICs
//!   so that it comes before the persistent virtio-blk disks and its namespace is `sd0`.
//!   On arm64 (M13) it is the first device on `virt`'s PCI bus (`pci0 dev 1`, the virtio
//!   devices are virtio-mmio); the kernel attaches the virtio-mmio disks before the PCI bus
//!   (`pciecam` comes after the `virtio_mmio` nodes in the device tree), so with the one
//!   persistent disk (`sd0`) and the boot image (`sd1`) the namespace is `sd2`.
//! - `--ahci FILE` (`qemu`, `smoke`): a SATA disk holding the raw image FILE (a relative
//!   path is in the run directory), ahci(4). On amd64 it is on the second port of q35's
//!   built-in AHCI controller (`ich9-ahci` at 0:1f.2, `ide-hd` on `ide.1`; the boot image is
//!   on `ide.0`). The controller's place on the bus does not change, so the disk is the unit
//!   after the boot image's (`sd2` with the one persistent virtio-blk disk). arm64's `virt`
//!   has no AHCI controller of its own, so (M13) an `ich9-ahci` is added as the first device
//!   on its PCI bus (`pci0 dev 1`) with the disk on port 0 (`ahci0.0`); as for `--nvme`, the
//!   virtio-mmio disks come first and the disk is `sd2`.
//! - `--scsi-cd ISO` (`qemu`, `smoke`, `smoke2`): a virtio SCSI host adapter with a CD-ROM
//!   drive holding the file `ISO` (read-only, `media=cdrom`; a relative path is taken from the
//!   workspace root): `virtio-scsi-pci` on amd64, `virtio-scsi-device` (virtio-mmio) on arm64,
//!   with `scsi-cd` on its bus. It is the LAST device added on both archs ([`add_devices`]),
//!   so the numbering of the other virtio devices is unchanged: amd64's PCI slots go up, and
//!   arm64 `virt` hands virtio-mmio slots out from the top down while the kernel finds them
//!   bottom up (the adapter takes the lowest slot, `vioscsi0`, found first; the NIC and the
//!   disks keep their slots, hence their names). Its `scsibus` is the one attached first.
//! - `--lsi FILE` (`qemu`, `smoke`): an LSI 53C895A SCSI adapter (`-device lsi53c895a`,
//!   siop(4)) with a `scsi-hd` at target 0 whose image is FILE in the run directory, made
//!   afresh (zeroed, [`LSI_DISK_BYTES`]) each run, as `--disk-fresh` makes its disks; with
//!   `--lsi-cd ISO`, also a read-only `scsi-cd` at target 1 holding `ISO` (a relative path is
//!   taken from the workspace root). amd64 only (arm64's GENERIC has no `siop`). It goes
//!   after `--scsi-cd`, the last devices ([`add_devices`]), so no other PCI slot moves.
//! - `--pci-serial FILE` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M13): a PCI serial card (`-device pci-serial`, QEMU's
//!   16550 behind PCI, 1b36:0002, puc(4) with com(4) on top) whose line is a file chardev:
//!   everything the guest sends to the card's UART is written to FILE in the run directory,
//!   made afresh each run. `--expect-pci-serial TEXT` (repeatable, `smoke`) then requires FILE
//!   to contain TEXT once the serial expectations passed ([`after_smoke`]). Both archs (the
//!   card sits on the PCI bus q35 and arm64's `virt` have). It goes after `--scsi-cd` and
//!   `--lsi`, the last devices ([`add_devices`]), so no other PCI slot moves.
//! - `--pci-bridges` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M16e, `smoke-ppb`): two PCI-PCI bridges, each with a
//!   virtio-blk disk behind it, for ppb(4): a PCI Express root port (`pcie-root-port`) with
//!   the disk `ppb-rp.img` on its secondary bus, and a conventional `pci-bridge` with the disk
//!   `ppb-br.img` in its slot 1, both bridges on the root bus of q35 and of arm64's `virt`
//!   (the firmware numbers their buses). The images are in the run directory, 64 MiB of
//!   zeroes made afresh each run ([`PPB_DISK_BYTES`]). They go after `--pci-serial`
//!   ([`add_devices`]), so no other PCI slot moves.
//! - `--machine pc` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M16e, `smoke-iic`): amd64's QEMU machine is i440fx's `pc`
//!   (PIIX3 and PIIX4: the ISA bridge at 00:01.0, the IDE controller at 00:01.1, the power
//!   management function with the SMBus at 00:01.3, the standard VGA at 00:02.0) instead of
//!   `q35`, so piixpm(4) has hardware to attach to. The boot image is on an `ich9-ahci`
//!   controller added after every other device ([`pc_boot_disk_args`]: q35 has one built in,
//!   and the firmware reads `pc`'s PIIX3 IDE channel with programmed I/O, which is minutes for
//!   the 170 MB Limine loads), so the kernel sees it as on q35 (`ahci0`, `sd1`); the PIIX3 IDE
//!   controller is left free. The NICs, the NVMe controller and the virtio-blk disks are plain
//!   PCI devices on the root bus, and `q35` stays the default. amd64 only (arm64 has only `virt`); `pc` has no
//!   built-in AHCI controller and its PCI bus is not PCI Express, so `--ahci` and
//!   `--pci-bridges` (a `pcie-root-port`) are refused with it. An IDE agent may use the same
//!   option ([`amd64_machine`]).
//! - `--ipmi` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M16e, `smoke-ipmi`, amd64 only): a baseboard management
//!   controller for ipmi(4): QEMU's simulated BMC (`ipmi-bmc-sim`) behind a KCS system
//!   interface on q35's ISA bus (`isa-ipmi-kcs`, I/O ports 0xca2-0xca3). QEMU describes it to
//!   the guest in its DSDT (an `IPI0001` device with `_IFT` 1, `_SRV` 0x200 and the I/O
//!   ports in `_CRS`) and in SMBIOS (type 38). The BMC's SDR repository is the file
//!   `ipmi-sdr.bin` in the run directory, written each run ([`IPMI_SDRS`]): one compact
//!   sensor record, a temperature sensor named `QEMU Temp`, which the simulator also makes a
//!   sensor of (scanning on, reading 0), so a driver that reaches the BMC exports it as
//!   `hw.sensors.ipmi0.temp0`. ipmi(4) does not, OpenBSD 8.0's as EmiBSD's: it maps `_CRS`'s
//!   `_MAX`, 0xca3, and every command fails (`smoke-ipmi`). ISA devices take no PCI slot, so
//!   nothing on the bus moves.
//! - `--reboot` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M13): QEMU runs without `-no-reboot`, so a guest reset
//!   restarts the machine (EDK2, Limine and the kernel again; the EDK2 variable store is the
//!   run's copy) instead of ending QEMU with status 0. `smoke-power` boots, runs `reboot`
//!   and expects a second boot's login. Without it, an ACPI power-off (`halt -p`, S5) and a
//!   reset both end QEMU with status 0, so a smoke that checks a power-off passes
//!   `--status 0` and rejects `rebooting...`, which `boot(9)` prints before every reset.
//! - `--nic MODEL` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M13): the NIC on QEMU's user network, the one that
//!   is vio0 otherwise, is an Intel PRO/1000 of that model instead, for em(4): `e1000`
//!   (82540EM), `e1000e` (82574L) or `igb` (82576); or `rtl8139`, QEMU's Realtek 8139C+,
//!   for re(4) (`smoke-re`); or `vmxnet3`, QEMU's VMware VMXNET3, for vmx(4)
//!   (`smoke-vmx`); or, for M16c's drivers (amd64 GENERIC only): `pcnet`, the AMD
//!   PCnet-PCI II, for pcn(4); `i82559er`, an Intel 82559ER, for fxp(4); `ne2k_pci`, a
//!   Realtek RTL8029, for ne(4); `tulip`, a DEC 21143, for dc(4). It takes vio0's place on the command
//!   line and its netdev (`n0`), so it is the only Ethernet interface (em0, which the
//!   kernel's network self-test configures as it does vio0) and no other device moves. On
//!   arm64 it is a PCI device on `virt`'s PCIe bus, where vio0 is on virtio-mmio. Not with
//!   `--vio-mq` (that is vio0's).
//! - `--fb` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M13): a display for the firmware's GOP. amd64's `q35` has its
//!   standard VGA (`-display none` only hides the window; OVMF's QemuVideoDxe drives it), so
//!   nothing is added there; arm64's `virt` has no display, so `-device ramfb` is added
//!   (ArmVirtQemu's QemuRamfbDxe gives a linear GOP frame buffer in guest RAM; a
//!   `virtio-gpu` GOP is blit-only, which Limine cannot use). `ramfb` is not a PCI device,
//!   so nothing on the buses moves.
//! - `--screenshot-after LINE` (`smoke`, M13, implies `--fb`): QEMU gets a human monitor on a
//!   Unix socket in the run directory (`monitor.sock`, instead of `-monitor none`; named
//!   relative to the checkout, or in the temporary directory, to fit macOS's 104-byte
//!   `sun_path`: [`monitor_sock`]); when a
//!   serial line contains LINE, `screendump` writes `screen.ppm` there, and once the serial
//!   expectations passed ([`after_smoke`]) the picture is checked against that line, which
//!   must read `x=X y=Y w=W h=H ink=N fg=RRGGBB bg=RRGGBB` (the kernel's `selftest=fb`,
//!   `kern/selftest.rs`): inside the box every pixel is `fg` or `bg`, exactly `N` are `fg`
//!   (the set bits of the glyphs drawn), and the box lies inside the picture.
//! - `--screen-text ROW:COL:TEXT` (`smoke`, M13, with `--screenshot-after`): the picture is
//!   checked for TEXT on wsdisplay's character grid instead, at row ROW and column COL of the
//!   grid the kernel's `selftest=wscons` line describes (`selftest: wscons grid x=X y=Y
//!   cw=W ch=H cols=C rows=R`, `kern/selftest.rs`): every character cell of TEXT holds
//!   exactly two colours, its background and the same text colour as the others, with some
//!   text pixels for a character and none for a space, and the cell after TEXT is blank
//!   ([`check_screen_text`]). `smoke-wscons` writes TEXT to `/dev/ttyC0` from the shell.
//! - `--sendkey-after LINE --sendkeys KEYS` (`smoke`, M13, `smoke-kbd`; repeatable, the pairs
//!   in order): QEMU gets the human monitor socket as for `--screenshot-after`; when a serial
//!   line contains LINE, each of the space-separated KEYS (QEMU key names: `h`, `shift-a`,
//!   `ret`, ...) is typed with the monitor's `sendkey` on the guest's keyboard (with `--usb`,
//!   the `usb-kbd` on `qemu-xhci`), one every [`SENDKEY_GAP`] ([`parse_sendkeys`],
//!   [`poll_sendkey`]). The run fails if a LINE never came.
//! - `--iommu intel|amd` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M16e, amd64): a DMA remapping unit on `q35`,
//!   QEMU's `intel-iommu` (VT-d, with an ACPI `DMAR` table) or `amd-iommu` (AMD-Vi, an `IVRS`
//!   table and the unit's own PCI function) with `dma-remap=on` (without it QEMU's AMD-Vi
//!   lets every device's DMA through untranslated, so the I/O virtual addresses the guest
//!   programs land on the wrong memory), added right after `-M q35` ahead of every PCI
//!   device. acpidmar(4) then gives each PCI device a domain, so the guest programs I/O virtual
//!   addresses: the virtio devices (vio0, the virtio-blk disks) get `disable-legacy=on,
//!   iommu_platform=on` ([`virtio_pci_props`]), so that they are modern-only and translate
//!   their DMA through the IOMMU (virtio_pci negotiates `VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM`); without
//!   it QEMU's virtio devices bypass the IOMMU. Emulated devices (AHCI, NVMe, ...) always
//!   go through it. On arm64 the one model is `smmuv3` (M16f, below).
//! - `--gic N` (`qemu`, `smoke`, `smoke2`, M16f; arm64): the version of `virt`'s interrupt
//!   controller, `2` (QEMU's default, ampintc(4) with its GICv2m MSI frame) or `3` (agintc(4)
//!   with its ITS, `gic-version=3`). Without the option the environment's `EMIBSD_GIC` (`2`
//!   or `3`) decides, so `EMIBSD_GIC=3 just smoke` puts every arm64 boot on GICv3; amd64
//!   ignores both ([`virt_machine`]).
//! - `--iommu smmuv3` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M16f; arm64): `virt` with its SMMUv3 in front of the
//!   PCIe bus (`iommu=smmuv3`), smmu(4); the virtio-mmio devices do not go through it.
//! - `--monitor-after LINE --monitor CMD` (`smoke`, M16f, `smoke-powerbtn`; repeatable, the
//!   pairs in order): QEMU gets the human monitor socket as for `--screenshot-after`; when a
//!   serial line contains LINE, the monitor command CMD (`system_powerdown`, ...) is sent
//!   ([`poll_monitor_cmds`]). The run fails if a LINE never came.
//! - `--tpm tis|crb` (`qemu`, `smoke`, M16e, amd64, `smoke-tpm`): a TPM 2.0 for tpm(4),
//!   QEMU's `tpm-tis` (the TIS FIFO registers) or `tpm-crb` (the Command Response Buffer) at
//!   0xfed40000, an ACPI `MSFT0101` device with a `TPM2` table, backed by the software TPM
//!   `swtpm` (found in `$PATH` or under `brew --prefix swtpm`, docs/SETUP.md). Each run
//!   starts its own `swtpm socket --tpm2 --flags startup-clear` with a fresh state directory
//!   `tpm/` and its log `swtpm.log` in the run directory and its control socket beside them
//!   (`swtpm.sock`, placed as the monitor socket is, to fit `sun_path`), waits for the
//!   socket, and gives QEMU `-chardev socket` + `-tpmdev emulator` + `-device
//!   tpm-tis|tpm-crb` ([`tpm_args`]). The TPM is not on a PCI bus, so nothing moves. swtpm
//!   is stopped when the run ends, however it ends ([`Swtpm`]'s `Drop`: kill, wait, remove
//!   the socket), and it also exits on its own when QEMU closes its control connection
//!   (`terminate`), so no swtpm outlives a run. `startup-clear` has swtpm send
//!   `TPM2_Startup(CLEAR)` once QEMU initialises it, so the TPM answers commands whatever the
//!   firmware does. Refused on arm64 (its GENERIC has no tpm) and outside `qemu` and
//!   `smoke`, which start swtpm.
//! - `{host-ms}` in a `smoke` `--send` text (M13, `smoke-clock`): replaced, as the text is
//!   sent, by the host's wall clock in milliseconds since the Epoch ([`expand_send`]), so a
//!   guest script can set its own clock readings beside the host's and compare the rates.
//! - `cargo xtask nvme-root --arch A [--duid HEX] [--out FILE]`: the disk `just smoke-nvme`
//!   boots from, `nvme-<arch>.img` in the run directory unless `--out` names another file.
//!   It is laid out as OpenBSD's installer lays a disk out: an MBR whose one partition is
//!   the OpenBSD one (`DOSPTYP_OPENBSD`, 0xA6) from sector 64, the disklabel in its sector
//!   `LABELSECTOR` (1), partition `a` (4.2BSD) from sector 64 holding the file system, `c`
//!   the whole disk. The file system is the userland's ffs image
//!   (`target/userland/<arch>/ramdisk.ffs`, made by OpenBSD's makefs, `userland/ramdisk.rs`)
//!   copied whole, with one change: its `/etc/fstab` names the root `/dev/sd0a`, where the
//!   ramdisk's names `/dev/rd0a` (rc(8)'s `mount -uw /` looks the root's device up there;
//!   `--root-dev sdNa` names another unit, for a disk that is not the first: `smoke-ahci`'s
//!   is `sd2a`, as diskmap(4) and DUIDs in fstab are not ported). The two lines have the
//!   same length, so the file is rewritten in place in the copy. The
//!   label's DUID is `--duid` (16 hexadecimal digits, [`NVME_ROOT_DUID`] by default): the
//!   kernel's command line names it with `bootduid=` (boot(8)'s `BOOTARG_BOOTDUID`), and
//!   `setroot` mounts the root from the disk whose label has it.
