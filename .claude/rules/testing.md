# Testing

Four tiers. Every change lands with the tier it belongs to.

1. **Host unit tests**: `just test` (`cargo test -p libkern -p bsd`). Pure logic (libkern, errno,
   page-allocator math, queue adapters, formatting) runs on macOS through `sys/arch/host`.
   Every new `pub fn` with testable logic gets a test in the same file: an inline
   `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in the `<TESTS>` zone at the end, whatever its length (there is no
   `tests.rs`; `rust-kernel.md`, file layout). `cargo xtask ports check` rejects a `tests.rs`, a
   `mod tests` outside `<TESTS>` and a `<TESTS>` zone without one.
   Table-driven tests for C-compatible behaviour (`strlcpy` return values, `crc32` vectors).
   The host tests share one process, and `setup_real_memory` (under
   `uvm_pmemrange::tests::LOCK`) gives each test fresh kernel memory, leaking the old one. So a
   global that test code touches and that holds kernel memory or pool items gets a
   `*_test_reset` called from `setup_real_memory` (or from the subsystem's shared setup), which
   forgets the old state without freeing it: freeing into, or growing from, an earlier test's
   memory or a pool initialised again since crashes a later test, and a panic inside
   `config_attach` or under a kernel lock then hangs the rest of the run (rule of
   2026-10-08, after the M16e close found it). Known resets: `rn_test_reset` (radix),
   `wsmux_test_reset` (the mux table), `autoconf_test_reset` (`autoconf_attdet`),
   `pf_osfp_test_reset` (the fingerprint list), `kmemstats_test_reset`; in `setup_net`,
   `pfi_test_reset`, `bpf_test_reset`, `enc_reset` and the interface lists; the server cache
   by `nfsrv_initcache` in the nfs tests' setup.
2. **Reference-backed tests**: `just test-ref`. Marked `#[ignore]`; they read `$OPENBSD_SRC`
   (set by the recipe to `reference/openbsd-src`) and cross-check constants against the C headers
   (`errno.h`, `param.h`, syscall numbers). They parse simple `#define` lines, nothing more.
3. **QEMU smoke tests**: `just smoke`. Boot both archs headless, assert serial lines and the exit
   code (amd64 `isa-debug-exit`, arm64 semihosting). Every change to boot, console, traps or
   scheduling adds or updates an expectation in `tools/xtask`.
   Every smoke and smoke2 run boots the `multiprocessor` kernel (recipes built with
   `--features qemu,multiprocessor`). Since the user's decision of 2026-10-07 (replacing the
   `-smp 4` everywhere of 2026-10-03) the CPU count is the justfile's `smp` variable,
   `-smp 2` by default (`ncpu`, from `EMIBSD_NCPU`, 2 or 4): every MP bug found so far needs
   only two CPUs. An expectation that names the count (`bsd: N processors`, `hw.ncpu=`,
   `cpuN at mainbus0`, `N of N application processors`, ...) follows `ncpu` through the
   justfile's derived variables (`aps`), so the recipe passes on 2 and on 4. A fixed group
   stays on `-smp 4` (`smp4`) to stress MP whatever `ncpu` says, with literal 4-CPU
   expectations: `smoke-mp` (mpstress, the kthread ping-pong), the multi-queue network
   smokes (`smoke-vmx`, `smoke-net-mp`, whose `-smp 8` boot stays as is) and
   `smoke-softraid` (the disk smoke under load). `smoke-up` is the one uniprocessor boot per
   arch, kept to catch a dependency on MP. New smokes follow suit: MP, `{{smp}}`, both archs;
   `{{smp4}}` only by the user's decision.
   `just ci-full` is `ci` with every `{{smp}}` recipe on four CPUs (`EMIBSD_NCPU=4`), then
   the installer end to end on both archs, also on four CPUs (the user's decision of
   2026-10-07): `smoke-install-amd64`, `smoke-install-arm64` (with `smoke-install-arm64-acpi`)
   and `smoke-install-boot-amd64`, `-arm64`, `-arm64-acpi`, which make the install media
   afresh from the tree, install to a fresh disk and boot the installed system; so it needs
   `just userland` and `just comp`. Two CPUs make the races rarer and nothing else checks the
   installer, so `ci-full` is mandatory before a milestone is marked met, and its result (rc
   and wall time) goes in the milestone's closing commit. A milestone split into lettered
   sub-milestones (M16a..M16g, the user's decision of 2026-10-08) runs it once, at the
   whole milestone's close; each sub-milestone closes with `just ci`.
   `just smoke` runs the recipes of the justfile's `smokes` list in parallel, `JOBS` at a time
   (default 4; `cargo xtask smoke-all`, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Parallel smokes"). So a smoke
   recipe: is added to `smokes`; builds nothing in its body (what it boots is built by its
   dependencies and by `smoke-build`, which runs alone first); writes per-run files only
   through xtask (`EMIBSD_RUN_DIR` puts them in `target/smoke/<recipe>/`), never a shared
   path under `target/`; and depends on no other recipe's disks or order. A recipe that
   needs a fixed host port has it to itself; a time limit is not tightened to fit a quiet
   machine (`EMIBSD_TIMEOUT_SCALE` scales them under parallel load). `smoke-all` also
   watches each recipe from outside (the user's decision of 2026-10-09, after a recipe's
   xtask hung in macOS's dynamic loader for 2 h 30 min, past every limit, since those live
   inside it): a recipe over the sum of its boots' limits times the scale plus five minutes,
   or whose log has not grown for ten minutes, has its whole process tree killed and is
   reported `TIMEOUT`, a failure; the others go on and `smoke-all` exits non-zero. So a
   waiting boot prints a line a minute (`boot::Heartbeat`), and a recipe step that runs for
   minutes without output (none does yet) must print as it goes or it is taken for hung.
   One retry, and only one, for a firmware bug that is not ours (the user's decision of
   2026-10-09): a smoke boot that fails with a line of `boot::FIRMWARE_FLAKES` on its console
   and no kernel line yet (EDK2's UhciDxe ASSERT on arm64, `docs/EXTERNAL_BUGS.md` EXT-1) is
   booted once more, says so in its log, and `smoke-all` counts it; anything else, or a second
   failure, fails as before. A new entry there needs the user.
4. **Differential tests** (M12+): `just diff-openbsd`, beside `ci`, not in it. The same
   scenarios on EmiBSD and on the OpenBSD snapshot of `tools/xtask/openbsd-snapshot.toml`
   (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "diff-openbsd"). Run it before closing a milestone and after any
   change to system calls, VFS or a file system. A new difference is a bug to fix in its own
   commit, or, only when EmiBSD must differ (an unported part with its visible stub, the
   branding, the snapshot's gap to the pin), an entry in `tools/xtask/diff-openbsd/
   expected.toml` with its reason, kept alone in its own step. An unported part that gets
   ported removes its entry. Scenario steps print only what is deterministic, or normalize it.

Always:

- `just clippy` runs clippy for amd64, arm64 AND host with `-D warnings`. All three must pass.
- `just fmt` is `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- `just ci` runs everything and is the definition of green.
- Test code may use `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` (allowed via `clippy.toml`); kernel code may not.
- A test that needs `alloc` enables the `alloc` feature explicitly until M3 makes it default.
- Never weaken or delete a failing test to get green. Fix the code or tell the user.
