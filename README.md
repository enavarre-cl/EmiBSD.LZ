## What is this

- A file-by-file port of the OpenBSD kernel, pinned to commit `3ce1f3f79392` of
  [openbsd/src](https://github.com/openbsd/src) (`reference/PINNED.md`).
- Not a new kernel design, not a Rust-for-Linux style hybrid, not a wrapper around C.
- The C sources are the specification. Names, structure and semantics stay OpenBSD's.
  Every deviation is written down, in the file and in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- A standalone `#![no_std]` kernel for amd64 and arm64, booted by Limine, run in QEMU.

## Status

Status: M16 (QEMU drivers) met with its last part, M16g (install images: `install80.img` on
both archs and amd64's `cd80.iso`, as `distrib/` makes them; an install from the stick with no
HTTP server); M17 (real hardware and virtualisation) next.

Stage 2 of the diagnostic tools (ps, fstat, vmstat, df) is also met. Exit criteria and dates are
in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md); the current state is in
[docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).

## What works today

Every line below is a recipe of `just smoke`, run on both architectures, on the
`multiprocessor` kernel with two processors (`-smp 2`; four for `smoke-mp`, `smoke-vmx`,
`smoke-net-mp` and `smoke-softraid`, and for every recipe in `just ci-full`); `smoke-up`
boots the uniprocessor kernel once per arch.

On one VM, with OpenBSD's own binaries from the ramdisk:

- Boot, autoconf, kernel self-tests, the ddb(4) prompt at a `-d` stop, a deliberate panic with
  a stack trace (`smoke`).
- init(8) and ksh(1) in single-user mode (`smoke-shell`).
- `/etc/rc`, getty(8), login(1) as root, the clock from the RTC (`smoke-login`).
- ifconfig(8), ping(8), route(8) over the routing socket (`smoke-net`, `smoke-route`).
- ps(1), fstat(1), vmstat(8), df(1), mount(8) over sysctl(2) (`smoke-diag`).
- pfctl(8) loading a ruleset that blocks a ping (`smoke-pf`); ipsecctl(8) over PF_KEY (`smoke-ipsec`).
- ftp(1) and nc(1) over TLS with LibreSSL, against servers on the host (`smoke-https`).
- A persistent disk: `sd0` on vioblk(4), fdisk(8), disklabel(8), newfs(8); after a second boot
  fsck(8) finds it clean and the file reads back (`smoke-disk`).
- Disk quotas: quotacheck(8), quotaon(8), edquota(8); a write as a user over its hard limit
  fails with EDQUOT and repquota(8) shows it; a hashed 5,000-entry directory; mount_mfs(8)
  (`smoke-ufsopts`).
- tmpfs(5) on /tmp; FAT, ISO 9660 and UDF images attached with vnconfig(8) and mounted with
  mount_msdos(8), mount_cd9660(8), mount_udf(8); newfs_msdos(8) on a vnd(4) over a tmpfs file
  and fsck_msdos(8) passing it (`smoke-fs`).
- softraid(4) over four vioblk disks: RAID 0, 1, 5, concat, RAID 1C and CRYPTO made with
  bioctl(8), RAID 6 with our own `sr6create` (bioctl has no `-c 6`); each gets an ffs and a
  file; after a reboot the volumes are assembled at boot, `bioctl -p` unlocks the encrypted
  ones and every file reads back; with a disk missing, RAID 1 and RAID 6 come up degraded
  and still read (`smoke-softraid`).
- ext2fs: newfs_ext2fs(8) on a persistent disk, files written with mount_ext2fs(8); after a
  reboot fsck_ext2fs(8) finds it clean and the files read back, and e2fsprogs' `e2fsck -fn` on
  the Mac passes the same disk image (`smoke-ext2fs`).
- FUSE: our own file system over OpenBSD's libfuse and /dev/fuse0 mounts, serves its files,
  refuses a write and unmounts (`smoke-fuse`).
- NTFS, amd64 only (as in GENERIC): an image made by our own generator, checked first by
  macOS's NTFS driver, attached with vnconfig(8) and mounted with mount_ntfs(8); a resident
  and a non-resident file read back (`smoke-ntfs`).
- Four processors (`-smp 4`) with the `multiprocessor` kernel: the application processors
  start, take IPIs and TLB shootdowns, two kernel threads ping-pong across CPUs, a thread per
  CPU stresses the pools, the page allocator and page faults through uvm, and the init
  self-test passes; amd64 tests
  each application processor's TSC against the boot CPU's, and on both archs every CPU runs
  its own clock interrupts with an uptime that never goes back (`smoke-mp`).
- ddb(4) on four processors: `sysctl ddb.trigger=1` from the shell stops every other CPU by
  IPI, `machine ddbcpu 1` moves the debugger to CPU 1, `machine cpuinfo` shows the other three
  stopped, and `continue` resumes them all (`smoke-ddbmp`).
- Audio: aucat(1) plays a tone through `/dev/audio0` on Intel HD Audio (azalia(4)) on both
  archs and on AC97 (auich(4)) on amd64; audioctl(8) and mixerctl(8) show and set the
  device, and QEMU's WAV capture must hold the tone (`smoke-audio`).
- USB: xhci(4) and uhub(4) enumerate QEMU's stick and keyboard; umass(4) makes the stick an
  sd(4) disk whose FAT partition mount_msdos(8) mounts, reads, writes and compares after a
  remount; uhidev(4) and ukbd(4) attach the keyboard (`smoke-usb`).
- Root on an NVMe namespace and on an AHCI disk, both archs (`virt`'s AHCI controller on its
  PCIe bus), mounted by the label's DUID without a ramdisk (`smoke-nvme`, `smoke-ahci`);
  cd(4) on vioscsi(4) mounting an ISO with mount_cd9660(8) (`smoke-cd`); siop(4) on QEMU's
  LSI 53C895A, amd64 (`smoke-siop`).
- More disk controllers, each partitioned, newfs'd, written, mounted read-only and compared:
  wd(4) through pciide(4) on the PIIX3 IDE of QEMU's `pc`, amd64 (`smoke-wd`); mpi(4) on
  mptsas1068 (`smoke-mpi`) and an SD card through sdhc(4) and sdmmc(4) on sdhci-pci
  (`smoke-sdmmc`), both archs; fd(4) reads a FAT floppy with mount_msdos(8), amd64
  (`smoke-fd`); vmwpvs(4) on pvscsi stops at `vmwpvs0: get configuration failed`, as
  OpenBSD 8.0 does (`smoke-vmwpvs`).
- ACPI on amd64: the AML interpreter, CPUs and I/O APICs from the MADT, PCI routing, MSI and
  MSI-X (vio(4)'s multiqueue path through intrmap(9), `smoke-mp`), acpitimer and acpihpet
  (`smoke-clock`).
- `halt -p` powers off and `reboot` restarts QEMU, through ACPI on amd64 and PSCI on arm64
  (`smoke-power`); the date from the RTC within a minute of the host (`smoke-rtc`); com(4)
  on QEMU's pci-serial through puc(4), amd64 (`smoke-puc`).
- em(4) on QEMU's e1000e (both archs) and e1000 (amd64), re(4) on rtl8139 and vmx(4) on
  vmxnet3 with four MSI-X queues ping QEMU's gateway (`smoke-em`, `smoke-re`, `smoke-vmx`);
  so do pcn(4) on pcnet, ne(4) on ne2k_pci and fxp(4) with inphy(4) on i82559er, amd64
  (`smoke-pcn`, `smoke-ne`, `smoke-fxp`). dc(4) with lxtphy(4) on tulip (amd64) and em(4)
  on igb (both archs) attach, link and, as on OpenBSD 8.0, pass no traffic (`smoke-dc`,
  `smoke-igb`).
- The frame buffer (efifb(4), simplefb) with wsdisplay(4) and the vt100 emulation: text
  written to `/dev/ttyC0` is read back from a QEMU screendump (`smoke-fb`, `smoke-wscons`);
  keys typed on QEMU's USB keyboard reach a reader of `/dev/ttyC0` and `/dev/wskbd0`
  through wskbd(4) and wsmux(4) (`smoke-kbd`). vga(4) is in and, as on OpenBSD under
  OVMF, attaches nowhere (`smoke-vga`).

- Our efiboot, OpenBSD's boot(8) for UEFI (BOOTX64.EFI, BOOTAA64.EFI), boots the MP kernel
  from an OpenBSD disk to `login:` beside Limine (`smoke-efiboot`); on arm64 `virt,acpi=on`
  it builds the device tree from the ACPI tables and the kernel attaches acpi0, acpipci(4)
  and pluart(4) at acpi, its root on a PCI disk (`smoke-acpi`).
- arm64 on QEMU's GICv3 (`virt,gic-version=3`): agintc(4) with its redistributors, IPIs on
  every CPU and MSI-X through the ITS for an NVMe root and, on ACPI, virtio-pci
  (`smoke-gicv3`); `EMIBSD_GIC=3 just smoke` puts every arm64 boot on it.
- smmu(4) on `virt,iommu=smmuv3`: the root on an NVMe namespace whose DMA the SMMUv3
  translates (`smoke-smmu`).
- QEMU's power key on the PL061: plgpio(4) and gpiokeys(4) attach, and `system_powerdown`
  is ignored, as on OpenBSD 8.0 (`smoke-powerbtn`).
- `boot -c`: UKC enables and disables devices before autoconfiguration (`smoke-ukc`), as
  the smokes of the devices GENERIC disables use it.
- ppb(4): a virtio disk behind a `pcie-root-port` and one behind a `pci-bridge` are labelled,
  formatted, mounted and read back, on both archs (`smoke-ppb`).
- acpidmar(4) on q35's `intel-iommu` and `amd-iommu`: the NVMe root mounts with every PCI
  device's DMA remapped (`smoke-dmar`).
- iic(4): piixpm(4) on `-machine pc` scans its SMBus; on q35 ichiic(4) finds the SMBus
  disabled by OVMF and stops, as OpenBSD 8.0 does (`smoke-iic`).
- ipmi(4) on QEMU's simulated BMC, and bios0 reading SMBIOS (`hw.vendor=QEMU`): the same
  lines as OpenBSD 8.0 on the same machine, the watchdog set through the BMC (`smoke-ipmi`).
- tpm(4) on QEMU's tpm-tis and tpm-crb backed by swtpm: TPM2_SelfTest answers `rc 0x0`
  (`smoke-tpm`); acpicpu(4) idles every CPU (`smoke-clock`).
- USB host controllers: uhci(4) on `piix3-usb-uhci` mounts, reads, writes and compares the
  stick (`smoke-uhci`); ohci(4) on `pci-ohci` mounts and reads it, and its first write halts
  QEMU's controller as on OpenBSD 8.0 (`smoke-ohci`); ehci(4) on `usb-ehci` attaches and,
  as on OpenBSD 8.0, gets no interrupt on amd64 and faults on a 16-bit register write on
  arm64 (`smoke-ehci`).
- USB devices: ums(4) on QEMU's usb-mouse, usb-tablet and Wacom tablet, events read from
  `/dev/wsmouse*` (`smoke-mouse`); usbdevs(8) lists usb-ccid under ugen(4), which carries a
  CCID command (`smoke-ugen`); cdce(4) on usb-net pings the gateway (`smoke-cdce`); ucom(4)
  over uftdi(4) on usb-serial carries text both ways (`smoke-ucom`); uaudio(4) plays the tone
  on usb-audio (`smoke-uaudio`).
- PS/2, amd64: keys sent with QEMU's `sendkey` reach the shell through pckbc(4) and pckbd(4),
  and the PS/2 mouse gives wsmouse(4) events through pms(4) (`smoke-pckbc`); opening the
  keyboard fails now and then, as on OpenBSD 8.0 (a race in the C), so the smoke retries.
- virtio: QEMU's balloon command inflates and deflates viomb(4) (its sensors and `vmstat -s`
  follow), viornd(4) feeds rnd(4)'s pool and `/dev/random` reads (`smoke-virtio`, both
  archs); viogpu(4) on arm64 carries the console, read back from a QEMU screendump
  (`smoke-viogpu`).
- Legacy devices, amd64: bytes written to `/dev/lpt0` reach QEMU's parallel port (`smoke-lpt`);
  the console bell and a spkr(4) tune reach QEMU's PC speaker through pcppi(4) (`smoke-bell`);
  eap(4) plays the tone on QEMU's ES1370, with midi0 on its UART (`smoke-eap`).
- The boot-only CD, amd64: `cd80.iso` as q35's CD-ROM boots our efiboot from its El Torito
  image, then `bsd.rd` from the CD, to the installer's first question; mount_cd9660(8)
  lists the CD by its Rock Ridge names (`smoke-cd80`).

Outside `just smoke`, because they take minutes under TCG (the user requires them at every
milestone close): `just smoke-install` boots `bsd.rd` through our efiboot and lets OpenBSD's
`install.sub`, under autoinstall(8), install the signed `base80` and `comp80` sets onto a
fresh disk (amd64, arm64, and arm64 on ACPI); `just smoke-install-boot-<arch>` boots that
disk on a fresh VM through the efiboot installboot(8) put on it, OpenBSD's `/etc/rc` runs,
and `cc hello.c && ./a.out` prints its line with OpenBSD's clang (`just comp` builds it).
`just smoke-install80-<arch>` (M16g) does the same from `install80.img` attached as a USB
stick, OpenBSD's installer answered over the serial console as a person would and the sets
read from the stick: no response file, no network, no HTTP server.

Between two VMs on a private link (`cargo xtask smoke2`):

- ping across the link (`smoke-link`); a wg(4) tunnel, with a pf rule on `wg0` (`smoke-wg`).
- An ESP tunnel (`smoke-esp`); IPComp inside ESP (`smoke-ipcomp`).
- pfsync(4) and pflow(4) (`smoke-pfsync`); pf `divert-to` (`smoke-divert`).
- TCP with nc(1): directly, through `wg0` and through ESP (`smoke-tcp`).
- tcpdump(8) on `vio1` and on `pflog0` (`smoke-tcpdump`).
- IPv6: ping(8) as ping6 to the other VM's global and link-local addresses, ::1 on lo0 (`smoke-inet6`).
- NFS over UDP and TCP with OpenBSD's portmap(8), mountd(8), nfsd(8), mount_nfs(8) and
  showmount(8): one VM exports a directory, the other lists and mounts it, reads a file and
  writes files the first one reads (`smoke-nfs`).
- Both VMs on the `multiprocessor` kernel with `-smp 4`: four softnet threads (eight with
  `-smp 8`), a ping across the link and through `wg0`, TCP with nc(1) directly and through
  `wg0`, loopback interfaces created and destroyed (`smoke-net-mp`).
- tcpbench(1) both ways at once, four connections each, for 15 seconds (`smoke-tcpbench`).

```

The real console also prints `unported: <name>` lines. Each one is a known gap, reported once.

## Quick start (macOS)

You need:

- Homebrew `rustup`, `qemu`, `limine` and `just`. The pinned toolchain installs itself.
- For the userland: Apple clang and an LLD 17 or newer with OpenBSD support.
- The sparse clone of the OpenBSD sources in `reference/openbsd-src` ([reference/README.md](reference/README.md)).

Every step is in [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md). Then:

```sh
just build        # kernel and the Rust init, amd64 and arm64
just userland     # OpenBSD's libc and programs, and the ffs ramdisk (slow)
just run-amd64    # boot in QEMU, serial console on stdio
just run-arm64
just smoke        # every boot test, headless, both architectures
```

The test image's root password is in docs/SETUP.md ("The test image's login").
`just` with no arguments lists every recipe.

## How it's built

- `sys/` mirrors OpenBSD's `sys/` path for path: `kern/tty.c` becomes `sys/kern/tty.rs`.
  Types live where the C header is; functions live where the C file is.
- Generic code reaches the hardware only through `crate::machine`, a set of traits that stands in
  for `<machine/*.h>`. Each arch implements them; the compiler checks it.
- One kernel crate, `bsd`, because kern, uvm and arch call each other. Only true leaves
  (`libkern`, `libz`) are separate crates.
- The userland is OpenBSD's C, cross-compiled unmodified with clang, on an ffs ramdisk
  made by OpenBSD's own makefs(8). So the kernel must speak OpenBSD's system call ABI exactly.
- `#![no_std]`, stable Rust only. No `static mut`. Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment.
- Gaps are explicit: `unported!()` yields `ENOSYS` and says so on the console. No `todo!()`.

Against a real OpenBSD (`just diff-openbsd`, beside `just ci`): the same 102 steps (291 system
call probes, file-system operations through OpenBSD's own utilities) on EmiBSD and on the
OpenBSD 8.0 snapshot nearest the pin, on both archs: 99 equal, 3 expected differences
(fifofs, core dumps, branding).

Details, boot flow and deviations: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Porting progress

From `cargo xtask ports status` at the commit of this README:

| todo | wip | ported | skipped | total |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 36 | 139 | 1169 | 37 | 1381 |

The tracker lists the files claimed by the milestones so far, not all of OpenBSD's `sys/`.
`wip` files are in use with visible stubs. Per subsystem: [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md).
Source of truth: [ports.toml](ports.toml).

## Testing

Four tiers:

1. Host unit tests (`just test`): pure logic runs on macOS through `sys/arch/host`.
2. Reference-backed tests (`just test-ref`): constants are cross-checked against the C headers.
3. QEMU smoke tests (`just smoke`): boot both architectures headless and assert serial lines and
   exit codes. A full run boots 67 single VMs and 24 pairs of VMs, all on the
   `multiprocessor` kernel with `-smp 2` (`-smp 4` for the `smp4` group, and for every recipe
   in `just ci-full`) except `smoke-up`'s uniprocessor boot per arch.
   The recipes run four at a time, each in its own `target/smoke/<recipe>/` with its own log;
   `JOBS=N just smoke` changes N.
4. Differential tests (`just diff-openbsd`, beside `just ci`): the same scenarios on EmiBSD and
   on a real OpenBSD VM (the -current snapshot nearest the pin, installed once with
   autoinstall(8) under `target/openbsd/`), compared step by step; every difference is fixed
   or listed with its reason in `tools/xtask/diff-openbsd/expected.toml`. About two minutes
   for both archs once installed.

`just ci` runs fmt, clippy for amd64, arm64 and the host, all tests, both builds, every smoke and
the tracker checks. Green `just ci` is the definition of done.

## Contributing and workflow

Porting one file:

1. Pick: `cargo xtask ports next` lists `todo` files whose dependencies are done.
2. Read the `.c`, its headers and the man pages it cites, completely.
3. Write `sys/<same path>.rs`: the original licence block, an `Upstream:` line, a `Deviations` list.
4. Test: host tests in the same file; `just ci` green.
5. Record: mark the file `ported` in `ports.toml`, then commit.

One commit per file or coherent cluster, with a trailer per ported C file:

```
kern: port subr_prf.c (printf, panic)

Upstream: sys/kern/subr_prf.c@3ce1f3f79392
```

The full process is in [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md).
