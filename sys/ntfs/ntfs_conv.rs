//! File name recode stuff: the UTF-8 hooks a mount uses to decode the names it is asked for
//! into UTF-16 (`ntm_wget`), to encode the names it returns (`ntm_wput`), and to compare two
//! wide characters (`ntm_wcmp`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ntfs/ntfs_conv.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The utf-8 routines were derived from src/lib/libc/locale/utf2.c.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ntfs_utf8_wget(const char **str)` takes the bytes and a position in them, which it
//!   advances; a byte past the end of the bytes reads as 0 (the C reads the bytes that follow
//!   in memory: in a lookup, the `/` or NUL after the component, which fails the same tests).
//!   Three-byte sequences keep the C's `s[0] & 0x1F` mask.
//! - `ntfs_utf8_wput(s, n, wc)` takes the room as a slice (`n` is its length) and returns the
//!   bytes written as a `usize`.
//! - The `DDPRINTF`s (`NTFS_DEBUG`, off) are left out.
