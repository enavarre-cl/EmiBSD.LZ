/* <CODE> */
//! The system's identity: what `conf/newvers.sh` writes into the generated `vers.c` of every
//! OpenBSD kernel build (`ostype`, `osrelease`, `osversion`, `sccs`, `version`), and what
//! `kern.ostype`, `kern.osrelease`, `kern.osversion`, `kern.version` and the boot banner
//! report.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/conf/newvers.sh @ 3ce1f3f79392 (replaced: see below)
//!
//! The system is **EmiBSD**, release **8.0** (the user's decision, 2026-10-03: the release
//! number tracks the OpenBSD release the reference pin follows; the pin's `newvers.sh` says
//! `osr="8.0"`, `STATUS "-current"`). The strings keep
//! `newvers.sh`'s layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! version   = "EmiBSD 8.0 (GENERIC) #<n>: <date>\n    <user>@<host>:<dir>\n"
//! osversion = "GENERIC#<n>"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `newvers.sh` is replaced by `sys/build.rs`, which hands the build's facts to this file
//!   as compile-time environment variables (`EMIBSD_VERS_*`). Nothing is read from a clock or
//!   a counter file, so a build is reproducible: `<n>` is `$EMIBSD_BUILD` (the justfile passes
//!   the number of commits, `git rev-list --count HEAD`; 0 without it), `<date>` is
//!   `$SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in `date(1)`'s format in UTC (the justfile passes the last commit's
//!   time; the epoch without it), `<user>` is `$USER`, `<host>` is `$EMIBSD_BUILD_HOST` (the
//!   justfile passes `hostname -s`; `localhost` without it) and `<dir>` is the `sys/`
//!   directory that was compiled, where OpenBSD prints its compile directory.
//! - The kernel configuration name is always `GENERIC`: `config(8)` is not ported and there is
//!   one configuration per architecture.
//! - `STATUS` is the release one (`""`), not `-current`: the system reports itself as the
//!   release, as the user decided.
//! - The strings are `&str` (their bytes are ASCII and NUL-free); `sysctl_rdstring` and the
//!   console take their bytes.

/// The operating system's name; a macro so `concat!` can build the other strings from it.

        "EmiBSD"
