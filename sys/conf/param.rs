//! Tunable kernel parameters that `config(8)` lets a kernel configuration override:
//! `sys/conf/param.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/conf/param.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 needs the clock rate (`delay(9)` on amd64 divides by `hz`);
//! M5 adds `maxprocess`, `maxthread` and `maxfiles` from `MAXUSERS` (80, as `GENERIC`
//! configures); M7b adds `nmbclust` for the mbuf allocator and `kern_sysctl.c` `fscale`;
//! the buffer cache adds `bufcachepercent` and `bufpages`; the System V IPC limits and
//! `utsname` arrive with the subsystems that read them.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `int` and `long` globals are atomics: `sysctl(8)` writes them at runtime in OpenBSD
//!   too. `bufcachepercent` and `bufpages` keep their lowercase names beside the
//!   `BUFCACHEPERCENT`/`BUFPAGES` defaults.
