/* <CODE> */
//! The root and swap configuration `config(8)` generates for a kernel: `swapgeneric.c` for
//! `config bsd swap generic` (GENERIC), and, as a deviation, the values its `swapbsd.c` would
//! hold for `config bsd root on rd0a swap on rd0b` (arm64's RAMDISK line; amd64's adds
//! `wd0b` and `sd0b`, drivers not ported).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/conf/swapgeneric.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - OpenBSD builds two kernels, `bsd` (GENERIC, "swap generic") and `bsd.rd` (RAMDISK,
//!   "root on rd0a"), and boot(8) loads one. Here one kernel serves both: the statics hold
//!   the generic values, and `swapconf_rdroot` switches them to the RAMDISK values when the
//!   boot loader hands over a ramdisk image (`sys/stand`, before `main`), as booting
//!   `bsd.rd` would. Without a ramdisk the kernel stays generic.
//! - `swdevt[]` has room for the RAMDISK configuration's one swap device; `uvm_swap.c`, its
//!   reader, is not ported.
