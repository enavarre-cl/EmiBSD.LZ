//! The Internet checksum of an IPv4 payload, with or without the pseudo header:
//! `in4_cksum`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/in4_cksum.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Checksum routine for Internet Protocol family headers (portable version), for the IPv4
//! pseudo header checksum: no need to clear non-pseudo-header fields in the IPv4 header. `len`
//! is the actual payload size, not including the IPv4 header and skipped header chain (`off
//! + len` should be equal to the whole packet). With `nxt` 0 there is no pseudo header (ICMP).
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The word loop is `netinet/in_cksum.rs`'s [`cksum_add`] (the C file carries a copy of
//!   `in_cksum`'s loop); the pseudo header's words are summed from a byte array laid out as
//!   `struct ipovly`.
//! - The result is a `u16`.
