//! TCP sequence number comparisons: `<netinet/tcp_seq.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/tcp_seq.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! TCP sequence numbers are 32 bit integers operated on with modular arithmetic. These
//! functions compare such integers: `a` is before `b` when `b - a`, taken modulo 2^32, is
//! less than 2^31.
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `SEQ_LT`, `SEQ_LEQ`, `SEQ_GT`, `SEQ_GEQ` are `const fn`s over [`TcpSeq`]. The C's
//!   `(int)((a)-(b))` is `a.wrapping_sub(b) as i32`: the unsigned difference wraps and is read
//!   as a signed number, exactly as the C cast does.
//! - `tcp_rcvseqinit(tp)` and `tcp_sendseqinit(tp)` are functions over the control block of
//!   `netinet/tcp_var.rs`.
//! - `extern tcp_seq tcp_iss` is `TCP_ISS` in `netinet/tcp_subr.rs`, where the C defines it.
