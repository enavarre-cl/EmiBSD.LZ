//! TCP FSM state definitions, per RFC 793, September 1981: `<netinet/tcp_fsm.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/tcp_fsm.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `TCPS_HAVERCVDSYN(s)`, `TCPS_HAVEESTABLISHED(s)` and `TCPS_HAVERCVDFIN(s)` are `const fn`s
//!   ([`tcps_havercvdsyn`], ...).
//! - The tables the C compiles only into the file that defines `TCPOUTFLAGS` (`tcp_output.c`)
//!   or `TCPSTATES` (`tcp_debug.c`) are always present: `tcp_outflags[]` is
//!   [`TCP_OUTFLAGS`] and `tcpstates[]` is [`TCPSTATES`], a table of byte strings without the
//!   NUL (kernel strings are bytes, `docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
