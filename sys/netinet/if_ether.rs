/* <CODE> */
//! Ethernet: frame layout, constants and the Ethernet ARP packet (`<netinet/if_ether.h>`),
//! and the Ethernet address resolution protocol (`netinet/if_ether.c`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/if_ether.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/if_ether.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The structures are the frames as they are on the wire: `ether_type`, `evl_tag` and the ARP
//! header fields hold network-order values (`ntohs(eh.ether_type) == ETHERTYPE_IP`), as in C.
//! `#include <net/ethertypes.h>` is `crate::net::ethertypes`.
//!
//! `struct arpcom` is what an Ethernet driver's softc embeds: `struct ifnet` first, then the
//! hardware address and the multicast list. `net/if_ethersubr.rs` has the functions over it.
//!
//! ARP keeps its cache in the routing table: a cloning route of a connected subnet makes a
//! host route per neighbour (`RTF_LLINFO`), whose gateway is a `sockaddr_dl` holding the
//! neighbour's hardware address and whose `rt_llinfo` is a `struct llinfo_arp` (the packets
//! held while the request is outstanding, the retry count). `arpresolve` answers from it or
//! sends a request, `in_arpinput` fills it from requests and replies (`arpcache`) and answers
//! requests for our addresses, and `arptimer` ages it. TODO in the C: add "inuse/lock" bit (or
//! ref. count) along with valid bit.
//!
//! Status: `if_ether.h` `ported`, `if_ether.c` `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct arpcom` is `#[repr(C)]` with `ac_if` first, as the C's `(struct arpcom *)ifp`
//!   cast needs; [`arpcom_of`] is that cast, checked: `ether_ifattach`, which receives the
//!   `Arpcom`, marks its `ifnet` (`Ifnet::is_arpcom`), and the cast panics on an interface it
//!   did not mark. The all-zero `Arpcom` is valid (a softc is `M_ZERO`). `ac__pad` is
//!   `ac_pad` (a double underscore is not snake case). `ac_trport`/`ac_brport` (SMR pointers
//!   in C) are atomics.
//! - `struct ether_port`'s `ep_input` returns the packet when the port does not take it, as
//!   the C's; the `void *` port is an opaque pointer.
//! - `ETHER_LOOKUP_MULTI`, `ETHER_FIRST_MULTI` and `ETHER_NEXT_MULTI` are functions that
//!   return the record instead of assigning their `enm` argument.
//! - `struct ether_extracted` points into the mbuf with raw pointers, as the C does (the
//!   packet data has no alignment guarantee, so they are read unaligned); `tcphdr` and
//!   `udphdr` are not ported, so `tcp` and `udp` are byte pointers.
//! - `etherbroadcastaddr`, `etheranyaddr`, `ether_ipmulticast_min`/`_max` and the `ether_*`
//!   functions are in `net/if_ethersubr.rs`, which defines them; `ether_ntoa(3)` and friends
//!   are userland.
//! - The address predicates (`ETHER_IS_MULTICAST`, `ETHER_IS_BROADCAST`, `ETHER_IS_ANYADDR`,
//!   `ETHER_IS_EQ`) take `&[u8; ETHER_ADDR_LEN]`; the `ETH64_*` ones and `EVL_*OFTAG` are
//!   `const fn`s.
//! - `ETHER_MAP_IP_MULTICAST(ipaddr, enaddr)` and `ETHER_MAP_IPV6_MULTICAST(ip6addr, enaddr)`
//!   are functions that return the Ethernet address.
//! - `struct llinfo_arp_iterator` (the C's smaller marker with the same first two members) is
//!   a whole [`LlinfoArp`] with no route: a Rust list links one type. `arptimer`'s marker is a
//!   static instead of a stack variable (only that timeout walks with one).
//! - The ARP packet in an mbuf is read and written as a copy (`ea_get`, `ea_store`): mbuf data
//!   has no alignment guarantee. The Ethernet header `arprequest`/`arpreply` hand to
//!   `if_output` in a `pseudo_AF_HDRCMPLT` socket address is written into its `sa_data`, as in
//!   C.
//! - `inet_ntop` (`netinet/inet_ntop.c`) is not ported: the log lines print IPv4 addresses
//!   with a dotted-quad `Display` adaptor, which is what it writes for `AF_INET`.
//! - The `la_hold_total` counter keeps its C name beside the `LA_HOLD_TOTAL` limit
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`); `arpcache` returns `bool` (the C's 0/-1); `arpresolve` is an
//!   `unsafe fn` over the raw destination address and answers `Result` (`EAGAIN`: the packet
//!   is held).
//! - `NFSCLIENT` (the `revarp*` state and functions behind it) is feature `nfsclient`;
//!   `NCARP` is not configured and is a comment at its site. `arpresolve` sets and clears
//!   `RTF_REJECT` under the kernel lock (`KERNEL_LOCK()`, nothing without `MULTIPROCESSOR`)
//!   and tests it without, as the C; `rt_flags` is a `Cell` of `net/route.rs`.
//! - The `revarp` state (`revarp_myip`, `revarp_srvip`, `revarp_finished`, `revarp_ifidx`) is
//!   atomics ([`REVARP_MYIP`], ...), one machine word each, as the C reads and writes them
//!   without a lock; `revarpwhoarewe` returns `Result<(InAddr, InAddr), Errno>` (the server's
//!   and the client's address, the C's two out parameters) and `revarpwhoami` the
//!   `Result<InAddr, Errno>` of the client's address.
