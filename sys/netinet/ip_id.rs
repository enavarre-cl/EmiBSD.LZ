//! Random IP sequence number generator: `ip_randomid`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/ip_id.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Use the system PRNG to shuffle the 65536 entry ID space. We reshuffle the ID we pick out
//! of the array into the previous 32767 cells, providing a guarantee that an ID will not be
//! reused for at least 32768 calls.
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ip_shuffle` and `isindex` are atomics: the C updates them without a lock from every
//!   output path; relaxed loads and stores are the same racy updates, without a `static mut`.
