//! Variables related to this implementation of the internet control message protocol:

//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/icmp_var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `enum icmpstat_counters` is [`IcmpstatCounters`] with the C's values; the C indexes the
//!   two histograms with arithmetic (`icps_outhist + type`), which [`icmpstat_inc_hist`] does.
//! - `icmpcounters` (`struct cpumem *`, `<sys/percpu.h>` not ported) is the static array of
//!   atomics `ICMPCOUNTERS` in `netinet/ip_icmp.rs`, which defines the C's pointer.
//! - `ICMPCTL_NAMES` (a `struct ctlname` table) comes with `<sys/sysctl.h>`.
