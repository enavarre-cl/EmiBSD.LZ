/* <CODE> */
//! Internet protocol control blocks: `<netinet/in_pcb.h>` and `netinet/in_pcb.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/in_pcb.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/in_pcb.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Every UDP and raw IP socket has an [`Inpcb`]: the local and foreign addresses and ports,
//! the cached route, the IP header prototype and the socket options of the IP layer. The
//! control blocks of one protocol live in an [`Inpcbtable`]: a queue of all of them and two
//! SipHash tables, one on the complete address quadruple (`in_pcblookup`, connected sockets)
//! and one on the local port (`in_pcblookup_local_lock`, bind(2)'s checks and the wildcard
//! matches). `in_pcblookup_listen` finds a socket bound to the local address or the wildcard
//! address. Raw IP and UDP input walk the queue with an iterator that marks its place
//! (`in_pcb_iterator`), so the table mutex can be dropped while a packet is appended to a
//! socket.
//!
//! The pcb table mutex guarantees that all inpcb are consistent and that bind(2) and
//! connect(2) create unique combinations of laddr/faddr/lport/fport/rtableid. It protects both
//! address consistency and inpcb lookup during protocol input. All writes to
//! `inp_[lf]addr` take the table mutex. A per socket lock is needed so that the socket layer
//! input has a consistent view of these values. In `soconnect()` and `sosend()` a per pcb
//! mutex cannot be used: they eventually call IP output, which takes sleeping locks, and
//! connect(2) does a route lookup for source selection. Protocol input should not switch
//! process per packet, so it spins on the mutex. So there are three locks: the table mutex
//! for writing `inp_[lf]addr/port` and lookup, the socket rw-lock to separate sockets in
//! system calls, and the socket buffer mutex for the receive buffer. Changing
//! `inp_[lf]addr/port` takes both the per socket rw-lock and the global table mutex;
//! protocol input only reads them during lookup.
//!
//! Locks used to protect struct members: \[I\] immutable after creation, \[N\] net lock,
//! \[t\] `inpt_mtx` (pcb table mutex), \[s\] `so_lock` (socket rwlock), \[a\] atomic.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - An `Inpcb` is an `inpcb_pool` item handed around as `&'static Inpcb`, valid while a
//!   reference is held (`in_pcbref`/`in_pcbunref`, the table mutex, or the socket's
//!   `so_pcb`); the members the C changes through a pointer are `Cell`s under the locks above.
//! - The C's unions (`inp_faddru`, `inp_laddru`, the header prototype `inp_hu`, the options
//!   and the multicast options) are their two members side by side: `inp_faddr`/`inp_faddr6`,
//!   `inp_laddr`/`inp_laddr6`, `inp_ip`/`inp_ipv6`, `inp_options`/`inp_outputopts6`,
//!   `inp_moptions`/`inp_moptions6`; a pcb uses the members of its family (`INP_IPV6`), as
//!   the C reads the union through the macro of its family. `inp_ip6_minhlim` (the
//!   `inp_ip_minttl` alias) and `inp_flowinfo` (`inp_ipv6.ip6_flow`) are methods.
//! - The `in6_*` pcb functions are `netinet6/in6_pcb.rs`'s; the `ISSET(inp_flags, INP_IPV6)`
//!   branches of this file (`#ifdef INET6`, feature `inet6`) call them.
//! - The `const void *laddr` of `in_pcbbind_locked`, `in_pcbpickport` and
//!   `in_pcblookup_local_lock` is an [`Inpaddru`] (`union inpaddru` by value), read through
//!   `iau_addr()`/`iau_addr6()` as the C reads the pointer as the address of the family
//!   `INP_IPV6`/`INPLOOKUP_IPV6` says; `zeroin46_addr` is [`ZEROIN46_ADDR`].
//! - `sotoinpcb` panics on a socket of neither `inetdomain` nor `inet6domain` (the C macro
//!   casts `so_pcb` blindly).
//! - `inp_pf_sk` is pf(4)'s state key. `inp_seclevel` is a `Cell` (`IPSEC` is configured
//!   since M9c).
//! - `struct inpcb_iterator` is [`InpcbIterator`], a whole `Inpcb` whose `inp_table` and
//!   `inp_socket` are `None`, so it can sit in the table's queue like the C's prefix-compatible
//!   structure. [`in_pcb_iterator`] is an `unsafe fn`: the iterator must stay in place until
//!   the walk ends. `inp_socket` is an `Option` for that reason only; [`Inpcb::socket`]
//!   returns the socket of a real control block.
//! - `in_pcbunref`'s three `KASSERT`s that the links are cleared are not made: the queue
//!   links are private to `sys/queue.rs`.
//! - `baddynamicports` and `rootonlyports` hold atomic words (written under the net lock by
//!   `ip_init` and the sysctls, read during port selection); `DEFBADDYNAMICPORTS_*` and
//!   `DEFROOTONLYPORTS_*` are slices without the C's terminating 0.
//! - `hashinit(M_WAITOK)` cannot fail in C; here its failure in `in_pcbinit` panics.
//! - `in_pcbaddrisavail_lock` clears the port and `sin_zero` of a copy of the address (the C
//!   clears them in the caller's mbuf and puts the port back).
//! - `in_pcbset_addr` takes its generic `struct sockaddr *`s as [`SockaddrUnion`]s (the
//!   SYN cache's `union syn_cache_sa`, its only caller), read by family.
//! - `NSTOEPLITZ` (`pseudo-device pf` needs `stoeplitz`) and `NPF` (pf(4)) are configured:
//!   the flow id of a connected or bound socket, `pf_remove_divert_state`, `pf_inp_unlink`,
//!   and the divert and redirected-localhost keys of `in_pcblookup_listen`. So is `IPSEC`
//!   (M9c): `in_baddynamic` refuses the `udpencap_port`.
//! - The `DIAGNOSTIC` `in_pcbnotifymiss` printfs are behind the `diagnostic` feature.
