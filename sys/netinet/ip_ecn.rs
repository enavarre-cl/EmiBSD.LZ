//!
//! ```text
//!                      Outer Hdr at                 Inner Hdr at
//!                      Encapsulator                 Decapsulator

//!     ECN Field        constructed by (I)           constructed by (E)
//! ```
//!
//! `ECN_ALLOWED` (full functionality): (I) if the ECN field in the inner header is set to CE,
//! then set the ECN field in the outer header to ECT(0), otherwise copy the ECN field to the
//! outer header. (E) if the ECN field in the outer header is set to CE and the ECN field of
//! the inner header is not-ECT, drop the packet; if the ECN field in the inner header is set
//! to ECT(0) or ECT(1) and the ECN field in the outer header is set to CE, then copy CE to the
//! inner header; otherwise, make no change to the inner header.
//!
//! `ECN_FORBIDDEN` (limited functionality): (I) set the ECN field to not-ECT in the outer
//! header. (E) if the ECN field in the outer header is set to CE, drop the packet; otherwise,
//! make no change to the ECN field in the inner header.
//!
//! The drop rule is for backward compatibility and protection against erasure of CE.
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M9c).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `u_int8_t *outer, *inner` arguments are references, so the C's "NULL pointer passed"
//!   panics cannot happen; `ip_ecn_egress` answers `bool` (`true` for the C's 1, keep the
//!   packet).
//! - `ip_tos_patch` takes the IP header as a mutable copy (`ip_var.rs`'s `mtod_ip`), which the
//!   caller stores back.
