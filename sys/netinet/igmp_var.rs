/* <CODE> */
//! `<netinet/igmp_var.h>`: Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), implementation-specific
//! definitions: the statistics, the sysctl names and the report a membership change asks
//! for. Written by Steve Deering, Stanford, May 1988. Modified by Rosen Sharma, Stanford,
//! Aug 1994. Modified by Bill Fenner, Xerox PARC, Feb 1995. MULTICAST 1.3.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/igmp_var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct igmpstat`'s `u_long`s are `u64` (LP64), the words `net.inet.igmp.stats` copies.
//! - `igmpcounters` (`struct cpumem *`) is the static array of atomics `IGMPCOUNTERS` in
//!   `netinet/igmp.rs`; `igmpstat_inc` bumps it.
//! - `struct igmp_pktinfo` has no `ipi_list`: the list of reports `igmp_fasttimo` collects
//!   (`struct igmp_pktlist`) is a `Vec` of them (`netinet/igmp.rs`).
//! - `IGMP_RANDOM_DELAY(X)` is [`igmp_random_delay`]; `IGMPCTL_NAMES` is userland's.
