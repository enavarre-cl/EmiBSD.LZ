/* <CODE> */
//! Interface Control Message Protocol: the definitions of `<netinet/ip_icmp.h>` and
//! `netinet/ip_icmp.c`: error generation, receive packet processing, and routines to turn
//! packets around back to the originator, and host table maintenance routines.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/ip_icmp.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Per RFC 792, September 1981; RFC 950, August 1985 (Address Mask Request / Reply); RFC 1256,
//! September 1991 (Router Advertisement and Solicitation); RFC 1108, November 1991 (Param
//! Problem, Missing Req. Option); RFC 1393, January 1993 (Traceroute); RFC 1475, June 1993
//! (Datagram Conversion Error); RFC 1812, June 1995 (adm prohib, host precedence, precedence
//! cutoff); RFC 2002, October 1996 (Mobility changes to Router Advertisement).
//!
//! [`Icmp`] is the message as it is on the wire, multi-byte fields in network order. The two
//! unions are `#[repr(C)]` unions ([`IcmpHun`], [`IcmpDun`]) and the C's `icmp_id`,
//! `icmp_seq`, `icmp_ip`, ... shorthands are accessor methods; every member is plain data,
//! valid for any bit pattern, so they are safe.
//!
//! `icmp_input` counts every message it accepts by type (`icps_inhist`), answers echo,
//! timestamp and mask requests (`icmp_reflect`, `icmp_send`), hands errors to the protocol of
//! the offending packet (`pr_ctlinput`) and redirects to the routing table, and passes every
//! message on to the raw sockets (`rip_input`).
//!
//! Status: `ip_icmp.h` `ported`, `ip_icmp.c` `ported` (M7b). The licence block of `ip_icmp.c`
//! carries the NRL notice with its advertising clause, accepted as BSD-4
//! (`.claude/rules/scope-and-stubs.md`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ICMP_V6ADVLEN(p)`, `ICMP_ADVLEN(p)` and `ICMP_INFOTYPE(type)` are `const fn`s.
//! - The message inside a packet is reached through [`IcmpPkt`], bounds-checked reads and
//!   writes at the C's member offsets: the packet may be shorter than `struct icmp` (8 bytes
//!   for an echo) and its data has no alignment guarantee, so no `&Icmp` is made over mbuf
//!   data. The C's `ICMP_ADVLEN`-style length checks come first, as in C, and the accessor
//!   panics where the C would read past them.
//! - The sysctl variables are `AtomicI32` statics; `icmpcounters` (`struct cpumem *`) is the
//!   static array of atomics [`ICMPCOUNTERS`]. `icmperrppslim_last`/`icmperrpps_count` are a
//!   `StaticCell` touched only through `ppsratecheck`, under its mutex.
//! - `icmp_error` and `icmp_do_error` take the C's `int type, int code` as `u8`s (the values of
//!   `icmp_type`/`icmp_code`); `icmp_reflect` returns `Result` (its `ELOOP`/`EHOSTUNREACH`)
//!   with the options mbuf through an `Option<&mut ...>` out parameter.
//! - `ICMPPRINTFS` (debug printfs) is not configured; `NCARP` (`carp_lsdrop`) is not
//!   configured: each is a comment at its site. `INET6` is (feature `inet6`): the length
//!   check of a v6-in-v4 message.
//!   `NPF` (pf(4)) is configured: the `PF_TAG_DIVERTED` handling of diverted connections.
