/* <CODE> */
//! IP implementation variables: statistics, the header overlay, `ip_output` flags, the
//! multicast options and the reassembly queues: `<netinet/ip_var.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet/ip_var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ipcounters` (`struct cpumem *`, `<sys/percpu.h>` not ported) is the static array of
//!   atomics `IPCOUNTERS` in `netinet/ip_input.rs`, which defines the C's pointer;
//!   `ipstat_inc`/`ipstat_add` bump it by [`IpstatCounters`], and `ipstat_dec` is
//!   `ip_deliver`'s `counters_dec`.
//! - `struct ip_moptions`'s `imo_membership` is a raw array of `Option<&InMulti>` (it grows
//!   with `imo_max_memberships`, as the C's does); `struct ipqent` and `struct ipq` hold
//!   `Cell`s (they change under `ipq_mutex`); `ipqe_ip` points at the fragment's header in its
//!   mbuf, read unaligned (`netinet/ip_input.rs`).
//! - The globals (`ip_defttl`, `ip_mtudisc`, `ipport_*`, `ip_forwarding`, `ipmultipath`,
//!   `ip_directedbcast`, `la_hold_total`, `ip_mtudisc_timeout_q`, `ipqent_pool`, ...) and the
//!   prototypes (`ip_output`, `ip_input_if`, ...) are defined by `netinet/ip_input.rs`,
//!   `ip_output.rs`, `ip_icmp.rs` and `if_ether.rs`; `rip_usrreqs` and the `rip_*`
//!   functions by `netinet/raw_ip.c`, which is not ported (`netinet/in_proto.rs` has the
//!   `rip_input` stand-in). `struct ipstat` as `sysctl(2)` returns it is here.
