/* <CODE> */
//! `fusefs.h`: the FUSE file system's sysctl identifiers, its per-mount structure and the
//! operations a daemon turned out not to implement.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/miscfs/fuse/fusefs.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The prototypes of the header are functions of the files that define them:
//! `fusefs_vops` (`fuse_vnops.rs`, `FUSEFS_VOPS`), `fusefs_fbuf_pool` (`fuse_vfsops.rs`,
//! `FUSEFS_FBUF_POOL`), `fusefs_file_open`/`fusefs_file_close` (`fuse_file.rs`) and the
//! device helpers `fuse_device_cleanup`, `fuse_device_queue_fbuf`, `fuse_device_set_fmp`
//! (`fuse_device.rs`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `FUSE_DEBUG` is not defined (as in GENERIC), so `DPRINTF` expands to nothing and every
//!   `DPRINTF` of the `.c` files is a comment.
//! - `struct fusefs_mnt`'s members that change after the mount (`undef_op`, `max_write`,
//!   `sess_init`) are `Cell`s; the others are plain.
