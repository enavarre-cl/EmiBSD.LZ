/* <CODE> */
//! The FUSE request buffers: `fb_setup` makes a fusebuf for an operation, `fb_queue` hands
//! it to the daemon and waits for the reply, `fb_delete` frees it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/miscfs/fuse/fusebuf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `fb_setup` returns the fusebuf as a `&'static Fusebuf` (a `fusefs_fbuf_pool` item, the
//!   `struct mbuf *` idiom); `fb_delete` takes it back and accepts `None` for the C's NULL.
//!   The operation is a `u32`, the type of the header's `opcode` it is stored in (an `int`
//!   argument in C).
//! - `fb_queue` returns the daemon's error as a `Result`; an error number that is not an
//!   [`Errno`] (the daemon chooses it) becomes `EIO`, where the C returns the number as it is.
//! - The host tests (`cfg(test)`) have no context switch: between queueing the fusebuf and
//!   sleeping on it, `fb_queue` runs the tests' simulated daemon (`TEST_DAEMON`), which reads
//!   the request from the device and writes its reply as the daemon process would; on the
//!   host the sleep then returns at once (`cold`). The kernel build has no such call.
