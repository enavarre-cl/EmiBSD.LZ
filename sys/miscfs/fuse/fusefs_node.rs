//! `fusefs_node.h`: the in-core node of a FUSE file (`struct fusefs_node`), its file handles
//! and the `ITOV`/`VTOI` conversions.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/miscfs/fuse/fusefs_node.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The prototypes of the header are functions of the files that define them:
//! `fuse_ihashinit`, `fuse_ihashget`, `fuse_ihashins`, `fuse_ihashrem` (`fuse_ihash.rs`) and
//! `fusefs_fd_get` (`fuse_file.rs`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The node is `malloc(M_FUSEFS)`ed by `fusefs_vget` and freed by `fusefs_reclaim`; the
//!   members the C changes through shared pointers are `Cell`s.
//! - `i_hashed` is new: it says whether the node is on its hash chain, which the C reads
//!   from `i_hash.le_prev != NULL` (the list links are private to `sys/queue.rs`); it is set
//!   and cleared exactly where the node is linked and unlinked.
//! - `ITOV(ip)` is the member `i_vnode` (a node always has its vnode: `fusefs_vget` sets
//!   it at creation); `VTOI(vp)` checks the vnode's tag and panics on a vnode that is not a
//!   FUSE one or has no node, where the C would follow the pointer.
