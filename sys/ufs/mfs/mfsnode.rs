//! `<ufs/mfs/mfsnode.h>`: the control data of the memory based file system.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/mfs/mfsnode.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A `struct mfsnode` is the `v_data` of the vnode `mfs_mount` makes for the file system's
//! "device": it is `malloc(M_MFSNODE)`ed there, handed around as `&'static Mfsnode` (the way
//! `Ufsmount` is) and freed by `mfs_reclaim`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members are `Cell`s, except `mfs_shutdown`, which is atomic: `mfs_close` (any
//!   process) sets it and `mfs_start` (the file system's process) polls it.
//! - `mfs_baseoff` is a user address (`usize`): the base of the file system in the memory of
//!   the process that called `mount(2)`, which `mfs_doio` reaches with `copyin`/`copyout`.
//!   `mfs_size` is the C's `long` (`i64`).
//! - `VTOMFS` is [`vtomfs`], which checks the vnode's tag and that it has data; `MFSTOV` is
//!   [`mfstov`], which asserts the vnode is set.
