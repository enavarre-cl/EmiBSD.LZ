/* <CODE> */
//! Block allocation: `balloc` defines the structure of file system storage by allocating
//! the physical blocks on a device given the inode and the logical block number in a file,
//! growing the last fragment into a block and building the indirect blocks on the way.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ffs/ffs_balloc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `bpp` is the C's out-parameter as `Option<&mut Option<&'static Buf>>` (NULL when the
//!   caller wants no buffer). A buffer `ffs_realloccg` handed back and that is written at
//!   once is cleared from `*bpp`, where the C leaves a stale pointer that every later path
//!   overwrites.
//! - `allocib` (a pointer into the dinode's `di_ib`) is the index it points at; `allociblk`
//!   is an array and a count; the block pointers in an indirect block are read and written at
//!   their index in the buffer's bytes (`inode.rs`).
//! - `VOP_FSYNC(vp, p->p_ucred, MNT_WAIT, p)` of the failure path is skipped when no thread
//!   runs (there is no `p` to pass).
//! - The quota calls are `quota.rs`'s: `ufs_quota.rs`'s with feature `quota` (`option QUOTA`),
//!   the no-quota answers of `ufs_quota_stub.c` without it.
