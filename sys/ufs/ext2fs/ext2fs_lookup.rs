//! ext2fs directories: reading them as `struct dirent`s (`ext2fs_readdir`), looking a name up
//! and finding where a new entry would go (`ext2fs_lookup`, `ext2fs_search_dirblock`), and
//! the routines that check, add, remove and rewrite directory entries (`ext2fs_dirbadentry`,
//! `ext2fs_direnter`, `ext2fs_dirremove`, `ext2fs_dirrewrite`), test a directory for
//! emptiness and walk `..` to keep renames from making loops (`ext2fs_dirempty`,
//! `ext2fs_checkpath`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ext2fs/ext2fs_lookup.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The file is `ufs_lookup.c` for the ext2 directory format: an entry does not store the
//! terminating NUL of its name, so the on-disk entries cannot be handed out as `struct dirent`s
//! and are converted one by one (`ext2fs_dirconv2ffs`); the directory block is the file
//! system block (`e2fs_bsize`), not `DIRBLKSIZ`. The host tests of these functions go through
//! the vnode operations, in `ext2fs_vnops.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - A `struct ext2fs_direct *` into a directory block is an offset into the block's bytes,
//!   read and written by `ext2fs_dir.rs`'s accessors (`e2d_ino`, `e2d_reclen`, ...), which
//!   convert from and to little-endian; `memcpy` of an entry that may overlap is
//!   `copy_within`.
//! - `ext2fs_dirconv2ffs` returns the `struct dirent` (`d_name` is the entry's name up to its
//!   first NUL, as `strncpy` copies it). `ext2fs_readdir`'s conversion stops with `EIO` at an
//!   entry whose header or name would run past the bytes read: the C reads on into its
//!   buffer.
//! - `ext2fs_search_dirblock` takes the next entry from `offset` at the top of its loop. The
//!   C's `continue` after a mangled entry leaves `ep` where it was, so on a read-only mount
//!   (where `ufs_dirbad` does not panic) it would report the same entry forever; here the
//!   skip to the end of the block ends the block's search, as in `ufs_lookup`. A name whose
//!   bytes would run past the block does not match.
//! - `ext2fs_dirbadentry` returns `bool` (`false` for the C's 0: it panics on a bad entry);
//!   `ext2fs_dirempty` returns `bool`; `*foundp` of `ext2fs_search_dirblock` is a `bool`.
//! - `ext2fs_direnter` zeroes the new entry's name padding: the C copies the byte after the
//!   name (`cn_namelen + 1`) and leaves the rest of its stack `struct ext2fs_direct` as it
//!   was.
//! - `dirchk` is `ufs_lookup.rs`'s [`DIRCHK`], the C's `extern int dirchk`.
