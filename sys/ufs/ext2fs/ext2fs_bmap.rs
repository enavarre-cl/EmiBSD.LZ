/* <CODE> */
//! ext2fs block mapping: `ext2fs_bmap` converts the logical block number of a file to its
//! physical block number on the disk, through the inode's block pointers and indirect blocks
//! (`ext2fs_bmaparray`) or through its ext4 extent tree (`ext4_bmapext`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ext2fs/ext2fs_bmap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Indirect blocks are on the vnode for the file. They are given negative logical block
//! numbers. Indirect blocks are addressed by the negative address of the first data block
//! to which they point. Double indirect blocks are addressed by one less than the address of
//! the first indirect block to which they point. Triple indirect blocks are addressed by one
//! less than the address of the first double indirect block to which they point.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ext4_bmapext` and `ext2fs_bmaparray` take the `struct indir` array as a slice and its
//!   count as `Option<&mut i32>`, as `ufs_bmaparray` does; the block pointers of an indirect
//!   block are read at their index in the buffer's bytes, little-endian (`letoh32`).
//! - `ext4_bmapext` starts from an empty path (the C's is uninitialised) and releases the
//!   leaf buffer `ext4_ext_find_extent` may hold once the extent is read; the C keeps it
//!   busy for ever.
//! - `curproc->p_ru.ru_inblock++` is skipped when no thread runs, as `vfs_bio.rs` does.
