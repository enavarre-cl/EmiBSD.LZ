//! ext2fs block allocation for a file: `ext2fs_buf_alloc` defines the structure of file
//! system storage by allocating the physical blocks on a device given the inode and the
//! logical block number in a file, indirect blocks included.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ext2fs/ext2fs_balloc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The buffer comes back as the `Ok` value (the C's `*bpp`).
//! - The block pointers of an indirect block are read and written at their index in the
//!   buffer's bytes (`bap[i]`), little-endian (`letoh32`/`htole32`).
//! - On failure the C marks the change in `i_e2fs_flags` (the on-disk `e2di_flags`, where
//!   `IN_CHANGE | IN_UPDATE` are `EXT2_UNRM | EXT2_COMPR`); here it goes to `i_flag`, where
//!   every other caller puts it.
