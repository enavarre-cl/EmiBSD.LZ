/* <CODE> */
//! The inode hash: the in-core inodes of every UFS mount, found by device and inode number
//! (`ufs_ihashget`), so that a file has one vnode however it is reached.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_ihash.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The chains are picked by a SipHash of the pair under a random key, so that an attacker
//! cannot predict which inodes collide.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ihashtbl`, `ihash` (the table's size - 1) and `ihashkey` are `StaticCell`s written once
//!   by `ufs_ihashinit` (from `ffs_init`, before any mount) and read afterwards.
//! - `ufs_ihashrem`'s `i_hash.le_prev == NULL` test (an inode that was never hashed) is the
//!   `IN_HASHED` test that follows it: the list links are private to `sys/queue.rs`, and the
//!   flag is set exactly when the inode is linked. The `DIAGNOSTIC` clearing of the links is
//!   `LIST_REMOVE`'s own (`_Q_INVALIDATE`).
//! - The `EXT2FS` branch of `ufs_ihashget` (`IS_EXT2_VNODE`: an ext2fs inode's link count is
//!   `i_e2fs_nlink`, an unsigned 16 bits, so `<= 0` is `== 0`) is under feature `ext2fs`.
