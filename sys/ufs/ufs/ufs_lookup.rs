/* <CODE> */
//! Directory operations: `ufs_lookup` (convert a component of a pathname into a locked
//! vnode, and find where a new entry would go), and the routines that check, add, remove and
//! rewrite directory entries (`ufs_direnter`, `ufs_dirremove`, `ufs_dirrewrite`), test a
//! directory for emptiness and walk `..` to keep renames from making loops.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_lookup.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `#ifdef UFS_DIRHASH` is feature `ufs_dirhash` (default, as GENERIC has the option).
//!   The dirhash's `goto foundentry`/`goto notfound` into the linear search are a `hashed`
//!   flag that skips the search, with `found` set by the dirhash path; `ufsdirhash_build`'s
//!   0 is `true`, `ufsdirhash_findfree`'s and `ufsdirhash_enduseful`'s -1 is `None`.
//! - A `struct direct *` into a directory block is an offset into the buffer's bytes, its
//!   members read and written by `dir.rs`'s accessors; `memmove` of an entry is
//!   `copy_within`.
//! - `dirchk` is the atomic [`DIRCHK`].
//! - `ufs_dirbadentry` returns `bool` (`true` for the C's 1, a bad entry) and takes the block
//!   and the entry's offset; `ufs_dirempty` returns `bool`.
//! - The `newdirbp` argument of `ufs_direnter` (the soft dependency code's) is kept and
//!   unused, as in C.
