/* <CODE> */
//! `<ufs/ufs/dirhash.h>`: the hash of a large directory. For fast operations on large
//! directories, we maintain a hash that maps the file name to the offset of the directory
//! entry within the directory file.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/dirhash.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The hashing uses a dumb spillover to the next free slot on collisions, so we must keep
//! the utilisation low to avoid long linear searches. Deleted entries that are not the last
//! in a chain must be marked [`DIRHASH_DEL`].
//!
//! We also maintain information about free space in each block to speed up creations.
//!
//! Dirhash uses a score mechanism to achieve a hybrid between a least-recently-used and a
//! least-often-used algorithm for entry recycling. The score is incremented when a directory
//! is used, and decremented when the directory is a candidate for recycling. When the score
//! reaches zero, the hash is recycled. Hashes are linked together on a TAILQ list, and hashes
//! with higher scores filter towards the tail (most recently used) end of the list.
//!
//! New hash entries are given an initial score of [`DH_SCOREINIT`] and are placed at the
//! most-recently-used end of the list. This helps a lot in the worst-case case scenario where
//! every directory access is to a directory that is not hashed (i.e. the working set of hash
//! candidates is much larger than the configured memory limit). In this case it limits the
//! number of hash builds to `1/DH_SCOREINIT` of the number of accesses.
//!
//! The main hash table has 2 levels. It is an array of pointers to blocks of [`DH_NBLKOFF`]
//! offsets.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct dirhash` is [`Dirhash`]: a `malloc(M_DIRHASH)` block whose members are `Cell`s
//!   (the C changes them through shared pointers under `dh_mtx`). `dh_hash` (the array of
//!   pointers to `ufsdirhash_pool` blocks) and `dh_blkfree` stay raw pointers beside their
//!   counts (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, a `malloc`ed array kept as a pointer and a count);
//!   `DH_ENTRY(dh, slot)` is [`Dirhash::dh_entry`]/[`Dirhash::set_dh_entry`] and
//!   `dh_blkfree[i]` is [`Dirhash::blkfree`]/[`Dirhash::set_blkfree`], which check the index
//!   and the pointer and panic where the C would read out of bounds or through NULL.
//! - The prototypes and the `ufs_mindirhashsize`/`ufs_dirhashmaxmem`/`ufs_dirhashmem`
//!   `extern`s are the definitions in `ufs_dirhash.rs` (feature `ufs_dirhash`, the C's
//!   `option UFS_DIRHASH`); this header is compiled always, as `inode.h` names
//!   `struct dirhash *i_dirhash` without the option.
