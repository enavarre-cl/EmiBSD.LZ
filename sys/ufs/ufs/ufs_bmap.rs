/* <CODE> */
//! Block mapping: `bmap` converts the logical block number of a file to its physical block
//! number on the disk. The conversion is done by using the logical block number to index
//! into the array of block pointers described by the dinode.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_bmap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Indirect blocks are on the vnode for the file. They are given negative logical block
//! numbers. Indirect blocks are addressed by the negative address of the first data block
//! to which they point. Double indirect blocks are addressed by one less than the address of
//! the first indirect block to which they point. Triple indirect blocks are addressed by one
//! less than the address of the first double indirect block to which they point.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ufs_bmaparray` and `ufs_getlbns` take the `struct indir` array as a slice and its count
//!   as `Option<&mut i32>` (the C's NULL `ap`/`nump` is `None`); the block pointers in an
//!   indirect block are read at their index in the buffer's bytes
//!   (`inode.rs`, `daddr32_at`/`daddr64_at`).
//! - `curproc->p_ru.ru_inblock++` is skipped when no thread runs, as `vfs_bio.rs` does.
