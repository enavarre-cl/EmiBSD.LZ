/* <CODE> */
//! `<ufs/ufs/ufs_extern.h>`: the prototypes of the UFS layer's functions, which the file
//! systems on it (`ffs`, `mfs`, `ext2fs`) call and put in their operation tables.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_extern.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The header declares no types; its prototypes are the functions of `ufs_bmap.rs`,
//!   `ufs_ihash.rs`, `ufs_inode.rs`, `ufs_lookup.rs`, `ufs_vfsops.rs` and `ufs_vnops.rs`,
//!   re-exported here so that `use crate::ufs::ufs::ufs_extern::*` reads like the C's
//!   `#include`. `ufs_init`, which the header lists under `ufs_inode.c`, is defined in
//!   `ufs_vfsops.c` (and `ufs_vfsops.rs`).
//! - The `FIFO` prototypes (`ufsfifo_read`, `ufsfifo_write`, `ufsfifo_close`) wait for
//!   `miscfs/fifofs` (`ufs_vnops.rs`).
