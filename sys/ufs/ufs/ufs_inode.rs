//! The end of an inode's life: `ufs_inactive` (the last reference went: free a removed file's
//! blocks and inode, write the times back) and `ufs_reclaim` (the vnode is being reused:
//! unhash the inode and drop what hangs from it).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_inode.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `UFS_DIRHASH`'s `ufsdirhash_free` in `ufs_reclaim` is under feature `ufs_dirhash`.
//! - The quota calls are `quota.rs`'s: `ufs_quota.rs`'s with feature `quota` (`option QUOTA`),
//!   the no-quota answers of `ufs_quota_stub.c` without it.
