/* <CODE> */
//! The file-system-type operations the UFS file systems share: `ufs_start`, `ufs_root`,
//! `ufs_check_export`, `ufs_init` and the generic half of `fhtovp`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_vfsops.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ufs_init`'s `static int done` is the atomic [`UFS_INIT_DONE`]; the host tests clear it
//!   to initialise again over fresh memory.
//! - `ufs_check_export`: without `nfsserver` there is no export list (`vfs_export_lookup`
//!   finds nothing), so every client is refused with `EACCES`, as the C does when the lookup
//!   fails. `credanonp` is a `*const Ucred` into the entry's `netc_anon`.
//! - `ufsdirhash_init` (`UFS_DIRHASH`) is under feature `ufs_dirhash`.
