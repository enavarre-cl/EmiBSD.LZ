/* <CODE> */
//! Trap entry point to kernel debugger: `ddb/db_trap.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/ddb/db_trap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The per-arch `db_ktrap` lands here with the trap frame saved in `ddb_regs`. `db_trap` asks
//! `db_stop_at_pc` whether to stop (a run command may want to go on silently), says where the
//! kernel stopped, prints the stack trace when the kernel panicked, and runs the command
//! loop; `db_restart_at_pc` then arms the run mode before the trap handler resumes.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `db_print_loc_and_inst` (`db_examine.c`, the symbol table and the disassembler) prints
//!   the address (`db_command.rs`'s stand-in). `db_show_all_procs(0, 0, 0, "o")`, which lists
//!   the threads on a CPU after a panic, is `kern_proc.c`'s and a visible stub.
//! - The "ddb.html" notice, which asks for an OpenBSD bug report, is not printed by this
//!   kernel; `ddb_msg_shown` is still set, so the thread list prints once.
