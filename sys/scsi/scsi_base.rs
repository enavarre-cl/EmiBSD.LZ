/* <CODE> */
//! The SCSI midlayer's common code: the I/O pools that meter an adapter's openings and the
//! handlers that wait on them, the allocation of transfers (`scsi_xs_get`/`scsi_xs_put`),
//! their execution (`scsi_xs_exec`, `scsi_done`, `scsi_xs_sync`), the error and sense
//! interpretation every device driver shares, and the commands every SCSI device answers
//! (TEST UNIT READY, INQUIRY, MODE SENSE/SELECT, PREVENT ALLOW, REPORT LUNS).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/scsi/scsi_base.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! How a transfer flows: a device driver either asks for one synchronously with
//! [`scsi_xs_get`] (which may sleep for an opening of its link and of the adapter's pool) or
//! queues an [`ScsiXshandler`] with [`scsi_xsh_add`], whose handler later gets a ready
//! transfer. It fills `cmd`/`cmdlen` and the data ([`ScsiXfer::set_data`]), then either sets
//! `done` and calls [`scsi_xs_exec`], or calls [`scsi_xs_sync`], which sleeps (or, with
//! `SCSI_NOSLEEP`, makes the adapter poll) until the adapter's `scsi_cmd` has ended the
//! transfer with [`scsi_done`], retries while the error says `ERESTART`, and returns the
//! errno. [`scsi_xs_put`] gives the transfer, the opening and the link's slot back.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `scsi_cmd_rw_decode` returns the block number and count as a tuple, where the C writes
//!   them through two pointers.
//! - `SCSIDEBUG` is not configured (`scsi_debug.rs` has the `SDEV_DB*` bits and the empty
//!   `SC_DEBUG*` macros). The `SC_DEBUG`, `SC_DEBUG_SENSE` and `#ifdef SCSIDEBUG` sites are
//!   comments, and the debug-only functions
//!   at the end of the C file (`scsi_show_sense`, `scsi_show_xs`, `scsi_show_mem`,
//!   `scsi_show_flags`, `scsi_show_inquiry_header`, `scsi_show_inquiry_match` and the
//!   `flagnames`/`quirknames`/`devicetypenames`/`scsidebug_*` tables) are not ported.
//!   `SCSI_DELAY` is not configured either (a comment in `scsi_init`). `SCSITERSE` is the
//!   cargo feature `scsiterse`.
//! - Functions returning 0 or an errno return `Result<(), Errno>`; `Err(ERESTART)` from an
//!   `interpret_sense` or [`scsi_delay`] means "retry", as the C's `ERESTART`.
//! - Buffers the C passes as `void *` plus a length (`scsi_inquire_vpd`, `scsi_mode_select`,
//!   `scsi_copy_internal_data`) are byte slices; typed ones are references to the
//!   [`ScsiWire`] structures. `scsi_mode_select`/`_big` clamp the length the header claims
//!   to the slice they are given (the C trusts it).
//! - `scsi_do_mode_sense` returns the page as `Option<usize>`, the offset of the page in
//!   `buf.buf` (the C's `void **page_data`, `NULL` being `None`), and `big` as a `bool`, in
//!   the `Ok` value; on an error the C's `*page_data` and `*big` are always `NULL` and 0.
//!   `scsi_mode_sense_page` and `scsi_mode_sense_big_page` likewise return an offset, and
//!   also `None` when the header puts the page past the end of the buffer (where the C
//!   would read past the union).
//! - `scsi_decode_sense` returns its 132-byte buffer by value instead of a `static char
//!   rqsbuf[132]`.
//! - The `scsi_xshandler` and `scsi_io_mover` that `scsi_xs_get` and `scsi_io_get` keep on
//!   their stack are linked into the run queues with the queues' `unsafe` mutators, as the
//!   futex waiters are (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`); the public [`scsi_ioh_add`] and
//!   [`scsi_xsh_add`] take `&'static` handlers.
//! - `scsi_link_shutdown` tells the transfer handlers on the pool's queue by the handler's
//!   `is_xsh` flag before casting them (see `scsiconf.rs`).
//! - `scsi_done` and `scsi_xsh_ioh` panic when the transfer has no `done`, the xshandler no
//!   `handler`, or the handler gets no opening, and `scsi_xs_put` when the transfer has no
//!   opening, where the C would call through or pass on a NULL pointer.
//! - The pools are `pool_init`ed with `size_of::<ScsiXfer>` and `size_of::<ScsiPlug>`;
//!   each item is written with its Rust constructor after `pool_get`, as `buf_get` does.
