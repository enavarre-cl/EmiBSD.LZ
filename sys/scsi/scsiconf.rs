/* <CODE> */
//! `<scsi/scsiconf.h>`: the SCSI midlayer's structures, which connect an adapter (host bus
//! adapter) driver, the `scsibus` above it, and the device drivers (`sd`, `cd`, `st`, ...)
//! attached to its LUNs: the adapter's entry points (`struct scsi_adapter`), one link per
//! LUN (`struct scsi_link`), one transfer per command (`struct scsi_xfer`), the I/O pools and
//! their handlers that meter the adapter's openings, the bus's softc and attach arguments,
//! and the big-endian helpers (`_lto4b`, `_4btol`, ...) every CDB uses; and `scsiconf.c`,
//! the `scsibus` driver: it attaches above an adapter, probes every target and LUN with
//! INQUIRY (REPORT LUNS when the device knows it), applies the quirk table, finds a device
//! identifier in the VPD pages, attaches the device driver that matches, and detaches,
//! suspends and resumes the links.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/scsi/scsiconf.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/scsi/scsiconf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The functions the header declares live in `scsi_base.rs` (the transfer and pool
//! machinery, `scsi_xs_get`, `scsi_xs_exec`, `scsi_done`, ...), in `scsi_ioctl.rs`
//! (`scsi_do_ioctl`) and, for `scsiconf.c` (probe, attach, detach, `scsiprint`,
//! `scsi_inqmatch`), at the end of this file.
//!
//! ## Ownership
//! - A [`ScsiLink`], its [`ScsiIopool`] when the link owns one, a [`ScsibusSoftc`] and an
//!   adapter's pool are long-lived kernel objects reached as `&'static`: `scsiconf.c`
//!   allocates a link at probe and frees it at detach only after `scsi_link_shutdown` has
//!   waited for every transfer, and a softc lives until its device detaches. Nothing may use
//!   them after that; this is the C's contract, as for vnodes and softcs.
//! - A [`ScsiXfer`] is a `scsi_xfer_pool` item, reached as `&'static ScsiXfer` from
//!   `scsi_xs_get` until `scsi_xs_put` gives it back (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, the `struct buf *`
//!   row). Between `scsi_xs_exec` and `scsi_done` the adapter owns it; after `scsi_done` its
//!   `done` callback (or `scsi_xs_sync`) does.
//! - `xs->data` is a raw pointer with its length, private to [`ScsiXfer`]: the issuer sets
//!   both with the `unsafe` [`ScsiXfer::set_data`] (the buffer outlives the transfer and is
//!   not touched by anyone else meanwhile), so that the adapter's and `scsi_base`'s reads and
//!   writes through it are sound.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Every member the C changes through a shared pointer is a `Cell`, as for `struct buf`;
//!   the iopool's mutex (`pool->mtx`) protects the run queues, `running` and the link's
//!   `pending` as in C, taken with `mtx_enter`/`mtx_leave`.
//! - `link->device_softc` is `Cell<Option<NonNull<Device>>>`: every device driver stores its
//!   softc, which begins with `struct device`, and `sc_print_addr` reads it as one; the
//!   driver gets its softc back with `Device::softc`.
//! - `link->interpret_sense` is a `fn` that is never NULL: [`ScsiLink::new`] sets it to
//!   `scsi_interpret_sense`, as `scsi_probe_link` does.
//! - `struct scsi_iohandler` has a private `is_xsh` flag, set by the `scsi_xsh_*` functions:
//!   the C casts any handler on a pool's queue to `struct scsi_xshandler` in
//!   `scsi_link_shutdown` and tells the kinds apart by comparing the `handler` with
//!   `scsi_xs_get_done`/`scsi_xsh_ioh`, but Rust does not promise distinct addresses for
//!   functions with identical bodies (`scsi_io_get_done` and `scsi_xs_get_done`), so the
//!   cast is guarded by the flag.
//! - The `void *` I/O resource (`io_get`'s result, `xs->io`) is [`ScsiIo`], a `NonNull`;
//!   NULL is `None`. `io_get`/`io_put` and the handler of an [`ScsiIohandler`] are `unsafe
//!   fn`s over the pool's `iocookie`/the handler's `cookie`, which `scsi_iopool_init` and
//!   `scsi_ioh_set` pair with them (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, the `bufq_impl` row).
//! - `struct devid` keeps its identifier bytes after the header, as in C; [`Devid::id`] and
//!   [`devid_cmp`] (`DEVID_CMP`) are `unsafe` for that reason. `devid_alloc`, `devid_copy`
//!   and `devid_free` are `scsiconf.c`'s.
//! - `struct scsi_inquiry_pattern`'s strings are byte slices without the NUL.
//! - `_lto2b` ... `_8btol` take and return slices (`&mut [u8]`/`&[u8]`) instead of `u_int8_t
//!   *`; they index the first 2..8 bytes (a shorter slice panics).
//! - `SID_ANSII_REV(x)` and `SID_RESPONSE_FORMAT(x)` are `const fn`s ([`sid_ansii_rev`],
//!   [`sid_response_format`]).
//! - The prototypes of the header are not repeated: Rust needs none.
//!
//! `scsiconf.c`:
//! - bio(4) is configured (`NBIO` is 1, `dev/bio.rs`): `scsibusattach` registers
//!   [`scsibusbioctl`] with `bio_register` and `scsibusdetach` calls `bio_unregister`.
//! - `NMPATH` (`mpath.h`) is only included by the C file, which uses nothing of it; mpath(4)
//!   is not ported (`subr_autoconf.rs`).
//! - `SCSIDEBUG` is not configured and `scsi_debug.h` is not ported: the `SC_DEBUG` sites
//!   and the `#ifdef SCSIDEBUG` blocks (debug masks in `scsi_probe_link`, the protocol
//!   level and the link's state in `scsi_print_link`, the match trace in `scsi_inqmatch`)
//!   are comments.
//! - `dma_alloc(9)` (`kern/dma_alloc.c`) is not ported: the INQUIRY, REPORT LUNS and VPD
//!   buffers come from `malloc(9)` through `DmaBuf`, freed when dropped (`dma_free`); the
//!   `M_TEMP` identifier buffer of `scsi_devid_pg80` is one too.
//! - The integer results are `Result<(), Errno>`; the "nothing there" `EINVAL` the probe
//!   functions pass up is `Err(EINVAL)`, and the `goto bad` of `scsi_probe_link` with an
//!   error of 0 is `Ok(())` after the link is freed.
//! - The C global `scsi_autoconf` is a `static` [`AtomicI32`] of the same name (beside the
//!   `SCSI_AUTOCONF` flag value it starts with). `atomic_setbits_int(&link->state, ...)` is
//!   a `Cell` update (under the kernel lock, as the rest of the link).
//! - [`scsi_inqmatch`] takes a slice of anything that is or begins with an
//!   [`ScsiInquiryPattern`] (`AsRef`) where the C takes a base pointer, a count and an
//!   element size, and returns the best entry and its priority. A pattern longer than its
//!   field goes on comparing the bytes that follow it, as the C's `bcmp` does
//!   (`"MATSHITA CR-574"` covers vendor and product).
//! - [`scsi_strvis`] stops writing where `dst` ends (the C trusts it to hold `4 * len + 1`
//!   bytes).
//! - `scsi_activate_link` does nothing for a link without a device (the C would call
//!   `config_deactivate`/`config_suspend` on NULL).
//! - `scsi_get_target_luns` never reads past the 256 entries of the REPORT LUNS buffer
//!   when the device claims a longer list (the C would).
//! - `scsi_detach_link` is `unsafe`: it frees the link.
//! - `devid_alloc` copies at most `id.len()` bytes; any missing ones stay zero.
