/* <CODE> */
//! The softc of sd(4), the SCSI disk driver (`sd.rs`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/scsi/sdvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `struct sd_softc` holds the generic device and disk, the queue of buffers waiting for the
//! device, the link to the target, and the geometry read from it (`struct disk_parms`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members the driver changes after attach (`flags`, `sc_link`, `params`) are `Cell`s:
//!   the softc is shared by reference between the device switch entry points and the
//!   transfer completions, as the C shares it by pointer. `struct disk_parms` is a plain
//!   `Copy` structure read and written whole through its `Cell` (`sd_get_parms` already
//!   works on a copy).
//! - `ISSET`/`SET`/`CLR` on `flags` are the methods `isset`/`set`/`clr`, as on `struct buf`.
