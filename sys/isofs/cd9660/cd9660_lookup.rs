//! Directory lookup on ISO 9660: `cd9660_lookup` (convert a component of a pathname into a
//! locked vnode, by a linear scan of the directory's records) and `cd9660_bufatoff` (the
//! buffer of a directory block).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/isofs/cd9660/cd9660_lookup.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The C's `goto`s between `searchloop`, `foundino`, `notfound` and `found` are a loop
//!   over the passes and a labelled block whose value says where the scan ended.
//! - A `struct iso_directory_record *` into the directory buffer is its offset in the
//!   buffer, viewed as an [`IsoDirectoryRecord`].
//! - `cd9660_bufatoff` returns the buffer and the offset of `offset` in it (the C's `res`)
//!   instead of filling `*bpp` and `*res`.
//! - The Rock Ridge name buffer is a `NAME_MAX + 1` byte array on the stack instead of a
//!   `NAME_MAX` byte `malloc(M_TEMP)`: the name translation of a record without an `NM`
//!   entry can be one byte longer than `NAME_MAX` (the associated-file prefix), which the C
//!   would write past its buffer.
//! - `NOSORTBUG` is not defined, as in GENERIC.

/// deleting and `LOCKPARENT` is specified, the target may be ".", but the caller must check
/// to ensure it does an `vrele` and `iput` instead of two `iput`s.

/// - check accessibility of directory
/// - look for name in cache, if found, then if at end of path and deleting or creating,

/// - notfound: if creating, return locked directory, leaving info on available slots, else
///   return error
/// - found: if at end of path and deleting, return information to allow delete; if at end
///   of path and rewriting (`RENAME` and `LOCKPARENT`), lock target inode and return info to
///   allow rewrite; if not at end, add name to cache; if at end and neither creating nor
///   deleting, add name to cache
