//! `cd9660_bmap`: the logical to physical block mapping of an ISO 9660 file, which is one
//! contiguous extent on the disc.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/isofs/cd9660/cd9660_bmap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The optional results (`a_vpp`, `a_bnp`, `a_runp`) are `Option<&mut>`s, the C's NULL
//!   being `None` (`sys/vnode.rs`); the block arithmetic is in `i64` (`daddr_t`).
