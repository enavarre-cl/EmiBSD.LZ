//! `<isofs/cd9660/cd9660_extern.h>`: definitions used in the kernel for cd9660 file system
//! support: the CD-ROM format type, the per-mount data (`struct iso_mnt`) and the block
//! arithmetic macros.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/isofs/cd9660/cd9660_extern.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `im_export` (`struct netexport`) is kept whether or not `nfsserver` is configured, as the
//!   C does (`vfs_export` answers `ENOTSUP` without it), as `ufsmount.rs` does for UFS.
//! - `root_extent` and `root_size` are `u32`, as `isonum_733` reads them (the C's `int` only
//!   differs past 2^31 blocks).
//! - `struct iso_mnt` is built whole by `iso_mountfs` and not changed afterwards, so its
//!   members are plain fields.
//! - `blkoff`, `lblktosize`, `lblkno` and `blksize` are functions over `i64` offsets and
//!   blocks (the C's `off_t`/`daddr_t`).
//! - The prototypes are the functions of `cd9660_vfsops.rs`, `cd9660_util.rs`,
//!   `cd9660_node.rs` and `cd9660_vnops.rs`.
