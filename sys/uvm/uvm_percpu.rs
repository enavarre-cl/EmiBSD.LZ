//! The per-CPU cache of physical pages: `<uvm/uvm_percpu.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_percpu.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Two magazines of free pages per CPU, which `uvm_pmemrange.c`'s `uvm_pmr_cache_get` and
//! `uvm_pmr_cache_put` fill and drain (`MULTIPROCESSOR && __HAVE_UVM_PERCPU`, which amd64 and
//! arm64 define), so concurrent page faults do not all contend for `uvm.fpageqlock`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The fields are `Cell`s: only the owning CPU touches its cache, at `splbio` (see
//!   [`UvmPmrCache`]'s `Sync`).
