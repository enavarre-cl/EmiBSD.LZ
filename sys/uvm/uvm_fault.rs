/* <CODE> */
//! `uvm_fault.h` / `uvm_fault.c`: fault handler.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_fault.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_fault.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A word on page faults. Types of page faults we handle:
//!
//! - case 0: layerless fault: no amap or uobj is present. This is an error.
//! - case 1: upper layer fault (anon active): 1A, read or write with `an_ref == 1`: I/O
//!   takes place in upper level anon and uobj is not touched; 1B, write with `an_ref > 1`:
//!   new anon is alloc'd and data is copied off (COW).
//! - case 2: lower layer fault (uobj): 2A, read on non-NULL uobj or write to
//!   non-copy_on_write area: I/O takes place directly in object; 2B, write to copy_on_write
//!   or read on NULL uobj: data is "promoted" from uobj to a new anon; if uobj is null, then
//!   we zero fill.
//!
//! We follow the standard UVM locking protocol ordering: MAPS => AMAP => UOBJ => ANON =>
//! PAGE QUEUES (PQ). We hold a `PG_BUSY` page if we unlock for I/O.
//!
//! The code is structured as follows: init the "IN" params in the ufi structure; ReFault
//! (`ERESTART` returned to the loop in `uvm_fault`): do lookups (locks maps), check
//! protection, handle needs_copy; check for case 0 fault (error); establish "range" of
//! fault; if we have an amap lock it and extract the anons; if sequential advice deactivate
//! pages behind us; at the same time check pmap for unmapped areas and anon for pages that
//! we could map in (and do map it if found); check object for resident pages that we could
//! map in; if (case 2) goto Case2; handle case 1: ensure source anon is resident in RAM, if
//! case 1B alloc new anon and copy from source, map the correct page in; Case2: ensure
//! source page is resident (if uobj), if case 2B alloc new anon and copy from source (could
//! be zero fill if uobj == NULL), map the correct page in; done!
//!
//! Note on paging: if we have to do I/O we place a `PG_BUSY` page in the correct object,
//! unlock everything, and do the I/O. When I/O is done we must reverify the state of the
//! world before assuming that our data structures are valid (because mappings could change
//! while the map is unlocked). The system keeps a "version" number of a map (every time you
//! write-lock a map you bump it), so we save the version number before we release the lock
//! and start I/O, then relock and check the version numbers to see if anything changed.
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M7a (part 3) ports the handler whole; the swap paths it reaches
//! stay reported until `uvm_swap.c` (M7).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `uvmadvice[]` is a constant table: `PAGE_SIZE` is a constant here, so the values
//!   `uvmfault_init` computes are too; `uvmfault_init` only checks them.
//! - Out parameters become return values: `uvmfault_promote` yields the anon and the
//!   page, `uvm_fault_check` the offset into the anon array (the C advances `*ranons`),
//!   `uvm_fault_lower_io` the object page; `ufi` is an `Option` where the C passes `NULL`
//!   (paging in anon data without a fault).
//! - `uvm_swap_get` and `uvm_swap_markbad` (`uvmfault_anonget`) are reported: nothing has a
//!   swap slot before `uvm_swap.c`.
//! - The fault starts with shared (`RW_READ`) upper and lower locks on every machine, as the
//!   C does on amd64 and arm64 (the host stands in for them).
//! - `pmap_nested` is 0 (no vmm), `__HAVE_PMAP_POPULATE` is not configured (the
//!   `MULTIPROCESSOR` COW paths need `!__HAVE_PMAP_MPSAFE_ENTER_COW`, which both machines
//!   define), `UVM_PAGE_OWN` is not
//!   configured, `TRACEPOINT` (dt) is not configured.
