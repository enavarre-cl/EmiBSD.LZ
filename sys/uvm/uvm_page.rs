/* <CODE> */
//! Resident memory system definitions and page ops: `<uvm/uvm_page.h>` and `uvm/uvm_page.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_page.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_page.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Management of resident (logical) pages. A small structure is kept for each resident page,
//! indexed by page number. Each structure contains a list used for manipulating pages, and a
//! tree structure for in object/offset lookups. In addition, the structure contains the object
//! and offset to which this page belongs (for pageout), and sundry status bits.
//!
//! Locks, as in the C: `I` immutable after creation, `a` atomic operations, `Q`
//! `uvm.pageqlock`, `F` `uvm.fpageqlock`, `o` owner lock (`uobject->vmobjlock` or
//! `uanon->an_lock`).
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 ports the page structure, the physical segments
//! (`uvm_page_physload`, `uvm_page_physget`, `vm_physseg_find`, `PHYS_TO_VM_PAGE`),
//! `uvm_page_init`, `uvm_pageboot_alloc`, the allocation and free paths (`uvm_pagealloc`,
//! `uvm_pglistalloc`, `uvm_pagefree`, `uvm_pglistfree`) and the queue and wiring helpers.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct vm_page`'s mutable fields are `Cell`s and `pg_flags` an atomic; `phys_addr` is
//!   plain, set when the page is written into its array. The `UVM_PAGE_TRKOWN` fields are not
//!   compiled in.
//! - `pg + n` in the vm_page array is [`VmPage::add`] (unsafe: the array is the invariant), and
//!   `pg + n` as an address for comparisons is [`VmPage::ptr_add`].
//! - `vm_physmem[]` and `vm_nphysseg` are behind [`vm_physmem`] / [`vm_physmem_mut`] /
//!   [`VM_NPHYSSEG`]: written on the boot CPU before `uvm.page_init_done`, read afterwards.
//! - `uvm_page_physload` after `uvm_init` needs `km_alloc` (`uvm_km.c`, later in M3): the
//!   non-preload path reports it and ignores the segment, as the C does when the allocation
//!   fails.
//! - `uvm_page_unbusy` takes `Option`s where the C accepts NULL or `PGO_DONTCARE`.
//! - `uvm_maxkaddr` belongs to `uvm_map.c`; it lives here until that file is ported.
//! - On a machine without an MMU (`PMAP_NOMMU`, the host double) `uvm_pagealloc_multi` asks
//!   for one physical segment: the buffer cache reaches a buffer's pages through the direct
//!   map there (`vfs_biomem.rs`).
