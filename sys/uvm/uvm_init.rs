//! Init the vm system: `uvm/uvm_init.c`. All global vars are stored in `struct uvm` to make
//! them easier to spot.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_init.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 brings up the page system; every later step of `uvm_init`
//! reports itself through `unported!` until its file lands (the map, the kernel object, the
//! pagers, amaps, anons, the kmem allocators).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `uvmexp_counters` (the C's per-CPU `COUNTERS_BOOT_MEMORY`) are the static atomics of
//!   `uvmexp` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, the `struct cpumem *` counters row), so `uvm_init_percpu`
//!   does not call `counters_alloc_ncpus` (which exists since M11a, `kern/subr_percpu.rs`).
//! - `averunnable.fscale` waits for `kern_synch.c` (M5).
