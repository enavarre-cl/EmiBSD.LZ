//! Machine address mapping definitions, the machine-independent section: `<uvm/uvm_pmap.h>`.
//! The machine-dependent section is the `machine::Pmap` contract (`sys/machine/pmap.rs`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_pmap.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. The prototypes it declares are the methods of `machine::Pmap`, added as the
//! milestones need them.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `pmap_statistics` counters are [`PmapCounter`]s, relaxed atomic words: a user
//!   pmap's are changed under its lock, but the kernel pmap's are changed by every CPU without
//!   one (the C's plain `long`s race there; a racing `Cell` would be undefined behaviour in
//!   Rust). Loads and stores stay separate, so the counts are as approximate as the C's.
