/* <CODE> */
//! `uvm_swap.c`: the swap system.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_swap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M7a (part 3) has only what the fault handler asks:
//! [`uvm_swapisfull`] and `SWSLOT_BAD`. The swap devices, `uvm_swap_get`/`put`, the
//! slot allocator and `uvm_swap_markbad` are M7 (the pagedaemon); until then the counters
//! they would move stay at zero, so "swap is full" is what every out-of-memory path sees.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `uvm_swap_data_lock` is not taken: nothing else writes the two counters yet.

/// 99% of the total swap space.
