/* <CODE> */
//! The external interface of `uvm`: `<uvm/uvm_extern.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_extern.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 has the types and flags the page allocator and `km_alloc` use:
//! `voff_t`, `vm_prot_t`, the map flag encoding, the `UVM_PGA_*`/`UVM_PLA_*` flags,
//! `PHYSLOAD_DEVICE`, `struct uvm_constraint_range` and the `kmem_*_mode` structures.
//! M6 adds `struct vmspace`. The kernel maps and the prototypes arrive with the files that
//! implement them.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `UVM_MAPFLAG` and its extractors are `const fn`s.
//! - In `kmem_va_mode`, `kv_map` (a pointer to a map pointer) waits for `vm_map`; the mode
//!   says which map by name until then.
//! - `exec_map`, which every machine's `machdep.c` defines and makes identically in
//!   `cpu_startup`, is one static here ([`EXEC_MAP`]) that the machines set. The same holds
//!   for `phys_map` ([`PHYS_MAP`]), the physio submap.
