//! `uvm_unix.c`: traditional sbrk/grow interface to vm.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_unix.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `sys_obreak` prints its failure with `printf`: there is no controlling terminal for
//!   `uprintf` yet.
//! - The coredump walk is a closure-free port: the callbacks are `fn` pointers returning
//!   `Result`, the `int` error of the C.
