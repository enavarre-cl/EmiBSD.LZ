//! The exported VM statistics: `<uvm/uvmexp.h>` (which carries no licence block of its own
//! upstream; it was split out of `uvm_extern.h`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvmexp.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. `struct uvmexp` is complete; `uvmexp_counters` (the per-CPU counters) and
//! `atomic_load_sint` arrive with `percpu` (M5).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Every field is an `AtomicI32`: the C mixes atomics (`[a]`), lock-protected fields and
//!   immutable ones; one type keeps the global sound before the locks exist, and the C's
//!   locking letters are kept in the comments.
//! - The same member list also declares [`UvmexpCopy`], the plain `#[repr(C)]` structure of
//!   `int`s that `sysctl(2)` copies out (the C copies `uvmexp` itself), and
//!   [`Uvmexp::snapshot`] fills it.
