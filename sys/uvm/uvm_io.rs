//! `uvm_io.c`: uvm i/o ops, reading another address space through `kernel_map`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_io.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `uvm_io` is what `kern.proc_args` (`sysctl_proc_args`) reads a victim's `ps_strings`
//! and argument strings with: each chunk of the victim's map is extracted into `kernel_map`
//! (`uvm_map_extract`), copied with `uiomove` (faulting the pages in as the kernel touches
//! them), and unmapped again.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `vm_map_t` is `&VmMap`, the `struct uio *` a `&mut Uio`, the `int` error a
//!   `Result`. `uvm_unmap_remove` cannot fail on `kernel_map` (no immutable entries are
//!   checked), so its result is not consulted, as the C ignores it.
