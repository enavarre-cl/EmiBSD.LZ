/* <CODE> */
//! The page daemon: `uvm/uvm_pdaemon.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/uvm/uvm_pdaemon.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 only needs a `uvm_wait` the allocator can name; it reports the
//! gap, because there is no daemon to wait for before kernel threads exist (M5). The daemon
//! itself (`uvm_pageout`, `uvmpd_scan`, the aiodone daemon) arrives with swapping (M7).
//! `uvmpd_tune` is ported (M8): `uvm_pageout` calls it first thing, and since the daemon
//! thread is not created, `main` calls it where the C forks the daemon, so `wiredmax`,
//! `freemin` and `freetarg` have their values (`sysctl(2)` and `mlock(2)` compare against
//! `wiredmax`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `uvmpd_tune` runs from `main` instead of from the page daemon's first loop.
