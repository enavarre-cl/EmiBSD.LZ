/* <CODE> */
//! The private header of the DES code (Eric Young's libdes, as in OpenBSD's `lib/des`): the
//! types of a key and of a key schedule, the byte/word helpers, and the permutation and round
//! macros `ecb_enc.c`, `ecb3_enc.c` and `set_key.c` share.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/crypto/des_locl.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `des_cblock` is [`DesCblock`]. `des_key_schedule` (sixteen `struct des_ks_struct`, each a
//!   union of an 8-byte block and two words, so 128 bytes that the code only ever reads and
//!   writes as 32 words) is [`DesKeySchedule`], an array of 32 words.
//! - The macros are functions: `c2l` and `l2c` read and write one little-endian word at the
//!   start of a slice instead of advancing a pointer; `PERM_OP` takes the two words by
//!   `&mut` (the scratch `t` is a local); `IP` and `FP` are [`ip`] and [`fp`]; `D_ENCRYPT` is
//!   [`d_encrypt`], reading the schedule as a slice and the round at the word index `s`.
