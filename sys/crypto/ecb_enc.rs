/* <CODE> */
//! The DES block transform: the 16 rounds of one DES encryption or decryption on a block
//! already put through the initial permutation, as `des_ecb3_encrypt` calls it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/crypto/ecb_enc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `des_encrypt2` takes the two words as `&mut [u32; 2]` and `encrypt` as a `bool`. The loops
//!   run the sixteen rounds in pairs as the C does; `DES_USE_PTR` (an alternative way of
//!   indexing `des_SPtrans`, undefined in the C) is not ported.

use super::des_locl::{DesKeySchedule, d_encrypt};

/// `des_encrypt2`: runs the rounds on `data` (left word, right word) with the schedule `ks`;
/// `encrypt` false walks it backwards.

    // required the des_SPtrans values in sp.h to be rotated 1 bit to the right. One perl script
    // later and things have a 5% speed up on a sparc2. Thanks to Richard Outerbridge
    // <71755.204@CompuServe.COM> for pointing this out.
