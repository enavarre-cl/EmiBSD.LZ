//! `errno(2)` values as the kernel sees them: `<sys/errno.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/errno.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Where C returns an `int` that is `0` or an errno, Rust returns `Result<T, Errno>`
//! (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`). The two kernel-internal pseudo-errors `ERESTART` and `EJUSTRETURN`
//! are variants too: they steer the syscall return path and never reach userland.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `EWOULDBLOCK` is an associated constant aliasing `EAGAIN`: a Rust enum cannot give two
//!   variants one discriminant.
//! - `ELAST` is an associated constant (`i32`), not a variant.
//! - `__BSD_VISIBLE` is always on: the kernel sees every value.

/// Declares [`Errno`] from one list, so the enum, `from_raw` and the test table cannot drift.
