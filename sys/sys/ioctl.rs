//! `<sys/ioctl.h>`: the `ioctl(2)` commands, which the header gathers from `<sys/ttycom.h>`,
//! `<sys/filio.h>` and `<sys/sockio.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/ioctl.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The three `#include`s are `pub use`s, so `crate::sys::ioctl::TIOCGETA` names what
//!   `<sys/ioctl.h>` makes visible. The `ioctl()` prototype is userland.
//! - [`ioctl_arg`] and [`ioctl_ret`] are not in the C: they are the casts every handler does
//!   on its `caddr_t data` (`*(int *)data`, `*(struct termios *)data = ...`), over the byte
//!   slice `sys_ioctl` hands down (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
