//! `ioctl(2)` command encoding: `<sys/ioccom.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/ioccom.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! An ioctl command keeps its number and group in the low 16 bits, the size of its argument in
//! the next 13 and the direction of the copy (`IOC_IN`, `IOC_OUT`, `IOC_VOID`) in the top
//! three bits of the low 32. Commands are `u_long` in C, `u64` here.
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `_IOR(g, n, t)`, `_IOW` and `_IOWR` take the argument type as a type parameter
//!   (`_iow::<Ifreq>(b'i', 12)`), and `size_of::<T>()` stands for `sizeof(t)`. The group is the
//!   C's character constant as a byte, the number a `u8`: the encoding has eight bits for each.
//! - The function-like macros are lowercase `const fn`s (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`): `_ioc`, `_io`,
//!   `_ior`, `_iow`, `_iowr`, `iocparm_len`, `iocbasecmd`, `iocgroup`.
