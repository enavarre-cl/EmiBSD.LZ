/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/proc.h>`: description of a process.
//!
//! These structures contain the information needed to manage a thread of control, known in
//! UN*X as a process; it has references to substructures containing descriptions of things
//! that the process uses, but may share with related processes.
//!
//! `struct process` is the higher level process containing information shared by all threads
//! in a process, while `struct proc` contains the run-time information needed by threads.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/proc.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M5 (part b) ports `struct session`, `struct pgrp`, `struct
//! tusage`, `struct process` and `struct proc` with the members the scheduler, the sleep
//! queues and the kernel threads use, the `S*` states, the `P_*`/`PS_*` flags, the `FORK_*`,
//! `EXIT_*` and `SINGLE_*` constants, `struct cond`, `struct cpuset`, `struct uidinfo` and
//! `tu_enter`/`tu_leave`. The members that belong to subsystems not here yet (`ptrace`,
//! `pinsyscall`, the `vnode`s, the file descriptors) are opaque pointers
//! or left out, each named in a comment at its place. The vmspace, (since `kern_prot.c`)
//! the credentials and (since `kern_sig.c`) the signal actions are typed pointers with
//! accessors (`vmspace()`, `ucred()`, `sigacts()`); `kern_sig.c` also brought the sigio
//! lists, `p_sigstk` and `p_sigval`, and `kern_unveil.c` the unveil table (`ps_uvpaths`, a
//! raw pointer to `kern_unveil.rs`'s `Unveil` slots, with its counts and `ps_uvdone`);
//! `kern_event.c` the process's `ps_klist` and the thread's poll kqueue (`p_kq`,
//! `p_kq_serial`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Members the owning thread or a lock mutates are `Cell`s; the flag words `p_flag` and
//!   `ps_flags` (`atomic_setbits_int`) are atomics, as are `p_pctcpu`, `p_siglist` and
//!   `ps_siglist`. The two signal lists are `AtomicU32` (`sigset_t`) where the C declares
//!   them `int`; the bits are the same.
//! - `ps_comm`/`p_name` are `[u8; _MAXCOMLEN]` NUL-terminated byte arrays, as in C.
//! - `p_wmesg` is `Option<&'static str>`; the sleep messages are literals.
