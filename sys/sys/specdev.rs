/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/specdev.h>`: the information maintained about special devices (`struct specinfo`),
//! the hash of device vnodes (`speclisth`) and the cloning-device helpers.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/specdev.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `si_specnext` is the vnode's own `v_specnext` (`sys/vnode.rs` explains why); the other
//!   shorthands (`v_rdev`, `v_specmountpoint`, `v_specparent`) are `Vnode` accessors.
//! - The union `si_ci` is two side-by-side members, `si_ci_parent` and `si_ci_bitmap`: a
//!   clone uses the first, its parent the second.
//! - `SPECHASH` is a `const fn`; `speclisth[]` is `SPECLISTH` in `kern/spec_vnops.rs`, where
//!   the C defines it; the `spec_*` prototypes are its functions.
