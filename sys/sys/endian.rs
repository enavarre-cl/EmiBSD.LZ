/* <CODE> */
//! Byte order: `<sys/endian.h>` together with `<sys/_endian.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/endian.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/sys/_endian.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The network headers (`netinet/in.h`, `netinet/ip.h`, ...) keep wire fields in network
//! order, as the C does; these are the conversions between that order and the host's.
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `<sys/_endian.h>` is folded in. Its double-underscore names (`__swap16`, `__htobe32`,
//!   `__bemtoh16`, ...) exist only so that headers can use them without exporting the public
//!   ones; Rust modules give that hygiene, so only the public names are defined.
//! - `_BYTE_ORDER` comes from the target (`cfg!(target_endian)`) instead of
//!   `<machine/endian.h>`: both archs are little-endian, and the compiler already knows.
//! - `__swapNNgen`/`__swapNNmd` (the constant-folding and the machine-specific swap) are both
//!   `swap_bytes`, which the compiler folds for constants and lowers to `bswap`/`rev`.
//! - The memory forms (`bemtoh16`, `htobem32`, ...) take a byte array of the right size
//!   instead of a pointer, so the read or the store cannot go past the field.
//! - `swap16_multi(v, n)` takes `&mut [u16]`; the length travels with the slice.
//! - The in-place `NTOHL(x)`, `NTOHS(x)`, `HTONL(x)`, `HTONS(x)` ("ancient stuff") are not
//!   defined: Rust writes `x = ntohl(x)`.
