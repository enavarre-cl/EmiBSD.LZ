//! `<sys/task.h>`: `task_add(9)`, the work items a task queue runs in a thread. The functions
//! and `struct taskq` live in `kern/kern_task.rs`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/task.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct taskq` is opaque in the header; Rust has no forward declarations, so the type is
//!   defined in `kern/kern_task.rs` (where the C defines it) with private fields and re-exported
//!   here together with `systq` and `systqmp`.
//! - `t_flags` is an `AtomicU32` (`Relaxed`): `task_add`, `task_del` and `task_pending` read
//!   it without the queue's mutex, as the C does, possibly from an interrupt handler.
//! - `t_func` is an `Option`: a task that `task_set` has not seen ([`Task::zeroed`], the C's
//!   zeroed `struct task`) has no function; `TASK_INITIALIZER` is [`Task::new`].
//! - `t_process` (the `kcov` identifier, `#if 1 /* NKCOV > 0 */`) is kept but never written:
//!   `kcov` is not configured.
