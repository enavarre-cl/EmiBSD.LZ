//! `<sys/mplock.h>`: the machine-independent ticket lock behind the kernel lock.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/mplock.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Both architectures' `<machine/mplock.h>` say `__USE_MI_MPLOCK`, so this is the only
//! `struct __mp_lock`. The functions (`__mp_lock`, `__mp_unlock`, `__mp_release_all`,
//! `__mp_acquire_count`, `__mp_lock_held`) and `kernel_lock` itself live in
//! `kern/kern_lock.rs`, which defines them only with `MULTIPROCESSOR`, as the C does.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `mpl_cpus[]`, `mpl_ticket` and `mpl_users` are atomics: each CPU writes its own
//!   `__mp_lock_cpu` but `__mp_lock_held` reads every CPU's, and the ticket is the C's
//!   `volatile` word. `WITNESS` (`mpl_lock_obj`) is not configured.
