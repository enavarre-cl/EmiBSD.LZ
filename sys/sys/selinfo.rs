/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/selinfo.h>`: used to maintain information about processes that wish to be notified
//! when I/O becomes possible (`select(2)`, `poll(2)` or `kevent(2)` on one of a driver's
//! objects).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/selinfo.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `si_note` is the object's `struct klist`: the driver's `*_kqfilter` hooks knotes on it,
//! and `selwakeup` (`sys_generic.rs`) posts `NOTE_SUBMIT` to them.

use crate::sys::event::Klist;

/// `struct selinfo`.
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Selinfo {
    /// `si_note`: kernel note list.
    pub si_note: Klist,
}
