//! Terminal attributes: `<sys/termios.h>`, as the kernel sees it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/termios.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Every flag is visible (`__BSD_VISIBLE`); `CCEQ` is [`cceq`].
//! - The `tcsetattr` family of prototypes is userland and not here; the `TCIFLUSH`..`TCION`
//!   constants of the same `#ifndef _KERNEL` block are, so the header is complete for the
//!   userland that is built against it. `<sys/ttycom.h>` (the tty ioctls) and
//!   `<sys/ttydefaults.h>` are modules of their own.
//! - [`Termios`] is an [`AbiPod`]: `TIOCGETA`/`TIOCSETA` copy it whole.
