//! Machine-independent kernel parameters: `<sys/param.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/param.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The machine-dependent half (`<machine/param.h>`: `PAGE_SIZE`, `KERNBASE`, `MSGBUFSIZE`, ...)
//! is reached through [`MachineParam`] and re-exported here, so `sys::param` is the one place to
//! import from, as `<sys/param.h>` is in C.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `<sys/param.h>` also includes `errno.h`, `time.h`, `resource.h`, `ucred.h`, `uio.h`,
//!   `srp.h` and `signal.h` for convenience. Those are modules of their own here, ported with
//!   their milestones; nothing is re-exported.
//! - `NULL` (`<sys/_null.h>`) and the integer limits of `<sys/limits.h>` are `Option`/null
//!   pointers and `i32::MAX`-style constants; neither header is ported.
//! - Function-like macros become snake-case `const fn`s: `ALIGN` → [`align`],
//!   `ALIGNED_POINTER` → [`aligned_pointer`], plus [`ctod`], [`dtoc`], [`btodb`], [`dbtob`],
//!   [`howmany`], [`roundup`], [`powerof2`], [`setbit`], [`clrbit`], [`isset`], [`isclr`].
//! - `MIN`/`MAX` are `core::cmp::{min, max}`; `offsetof` is `core::mem::offset_of!`; `nitems`
//!   is `slice::len`; `SET`/`CLR`/`ISSET` are `|=`, `&= !` and `&` (or `bitflags` methods).
//! - `NBBY` belongs to `<sys/select.h>` (not ported yet); the bitmap helpers use `u8::BITS`.
//! - `NBPG`, `PGSHIFT`, `PGOFSET` are defined here once; every OpenBSD architecture defines
//!   them identically from `PAGE_*`.
