//! `<sys/resourcevar.h>`: the kernel's shareable process resource limits.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/resourcevar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` except `ADDUPROF`, which waits for `addupc_task` (`subr_prof.c`, with
//! the profiling AST). The prototypes are the functions of `kern/kern_resource.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pl_rlimit` is an array of `Cell<Rlimit>`: a `plimit` is shared copy-on-write and only
//!   written by `lim_write_begin`'s exclusive copy, under `rlimit_lock`.
