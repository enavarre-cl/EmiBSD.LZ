//! `<sys/evcount.h>`: event counters, the interrupt counts `vmstat -i` shows.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/evcount.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. Milestone M4 ports `struct evcount`; M11e gives `ec_percpu` its type,
//! the `struct cpumem *` of the per-CPU counters (`subr_percpu.c`). The functions are
//! `kern/subr_evcount.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ec_count` is the first field and an `AtomicU64`: the amd64 interrupt stubs increment it
//!   in assembly through the handler's `ih_count`, and `evcount_inc` from Rust.
//! - `ec_name` is a `&'static str` (the C's `const char *` is always a driver name).
//! - `ec_percpu` is an `Option<CpumemPtr>` (`NULL` is `None`).
