//! `<sys/sched.h>`: the per-CPU scheduler state and the CPU-state statistics.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/sched.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. Milestone M5 (part a, the clocks) ports the `CP_*` states, `struct
//! cpustats`, the `SPCF_*` flags, `SCHED_NQS`/`SCHED_PPQ`/`NICE_WEIGHT`/`ESTCPULIM` and the
//! members of `struct schedstate_percpu` the clock interrupts use: the four clockintr
//! handles, `spc_cp_time` with its lock, `spc_schedticks`, `spc_schedflags`, `spc_nrun`,
//! `spc_whichqs`, `spc_spinning`, `spc_curpriority`, `spc_runtime`; part b adds the run
//! queues (`spc_qs`, `spc_idleproc`, `spc_deadproc`); M11a the SMR members (`spc_deferred`,
//! `spc_ndeferred`, `spc_smrdepth`, `spc_smrexpedite`, `spc_smrgp`, used by
//! `kern/kern_smr.rs`) and `cpu_is_idle`. The functions it declares are in
//! `kern/kern_sched.rs` and `kern/sched_bsd.rs`; `sched_lock` and the `SCHED_LOCK*` macros
//! in `sched_bsd.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `spc_schedflags` (`volatile int`, set with `atomic_setbits_int`) is an `AtomicI32`;
//!   `spc_whichqs` and `spc_spinning` (`volatile`) `AtomicU32`s; `spc_curpriority` and
//!   `spc_smrgp` (read by other CPUs, `volatile`/`READ_ONCE` in C) `AtomicU8`s.
//! - `spc_nrun` (changed under `sched_lock`, read without it by `update_loadavg` and the
//!   other CPUs' cost estimates) is an `AtomicU32`, and `spc_cp_time` (written by the
//!   CPU's `statclock`, read by sysctl under the `pc_lock` generation protocol) holds
//!   `AtomicU64`s; relaxed accesses compile to the C's plain loads and stores.
