/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/rwlock.h>`: multiple readers, single writer lock.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/rwlock.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Simplistic implementation modelled after rw locks in Solaris.
//!
//! The `rwl_owner` has the following layout: `[ owner or count of readers | wrlock | wrwant
//! | wait ]`. When the WAIT bit is set (bit 0), the lock has waiters sleeping on it. When the
//! WRWANT bit is set (bit 1), at least one waiter wants a write lock. When the WRLOCK bit is
//! set (bit 2) the lock is currently write-locked. When write locked, the upper bits contain
//! the `struct proc *` pointer to the writer, otherwise they count the number of readers.
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7a). The functions are in `kern/kern_rwlock.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `WITNESS` is not configured: `struct lock_object` (`rwl_lock_obj`), `RWLOCK_LO_FLAGS`,
//!   `RRWLOCK_LO_FLAGS`, `RWLOCK_LO_INITIALIZER` and the `lock_type` arguments of the init
//!   functions do not exist; `RWL_NOWITNESS` is accepted and ignored.
//! - `RWLOCK_INITIALIZER(name)` is `Rwlock::new(name)`, `RWLOCK_INITIALIZER_TRACE` is
//!   `Rwlock::new_trace`; the fields are atomics (`volatile` in C) and `Cell`s.
//! - `rwl_name` is an `Option` so that the all-zero lock is a valid value, as the C's is: a
//!   lock embedded in an `M_ZERO` allocation (`struct ifnet`'s `if_maddrlock`, a softc) is
//!   only named by `rw_init` later; [`Rwlock::name`] reads it as the wait message.
