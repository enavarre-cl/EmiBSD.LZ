/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/tprintf.h>`: the handle `tprintf(9)` sends a message to a process's controlling
//! terminal through.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/tprintf.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The functions the header declares are `kern/subr_prf.rs`'s (`tprintf_open`,
//! `tprintf_close`, `tprintf`), compiled with feature `nfsclient` or `nfsserver`, the only
//! users, as the C's `#if defined(NFSSERVER) || defined(NFSCLIENT)` does.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `tpr_t` (`struct session *`, NULL when the process has no controlling terminal) is the
//!   type alias [`Tpr`], an `Option` of a session reference.

use crate::sys::proc::Session;

/// `tpr_t`: a `tprintf_open` handle, the session whose controlling terminal gets the message,
/// or `None` (the C's NULL) when the process cannot be printed to.
pub type Tpr = Option<&'static Session>;
