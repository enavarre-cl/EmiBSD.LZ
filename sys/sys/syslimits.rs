//! POSIX system limits: `<sys/syslimits.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/syslimits.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Every value is visible: the kernel compiles with `__BSD_VISIBLE`, which enables them all.
//! - Byte counts and object counts are `usize`. `LINK_MAX` is a [`Nlink`]; `NZERO` is an `i32`
//!   because nice values are signed; `BC_*_MAX` and `SEM_VALUE_MAX` keep the width of the
//!   `INT_MAX`/`UINT_MAX` they are defined from.
