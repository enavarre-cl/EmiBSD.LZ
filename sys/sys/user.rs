//! `<sys/user.h>`: per process structure containing data that isn't needed in core when the
//! process isn't running (esp. when swapped out). This structure may or may not be at the
//! same kernel address in all processes.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/user.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M5). The u-area is the first part of a thread's kernel stack
//! (`USPACE` bytes from `p_addr`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `Uarea` is the u-area of `proc0` as each `locore` reserves it in C (`proc0paddr`: the
//!   `struct user` at the bottom, `USPACE` bytes, page aligned); a type here so both
//!   architectures define the static the same way.
