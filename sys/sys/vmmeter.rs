//! `<sys/vmmeter.h>`: system wide statistics counters. Look in `uvm/uvm_extern.rs` for the
//! UVM equivalent.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/vmmeter.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M5). `forkstat` itself lives in `kern/kern_fork.rs`, `vmtotal` in
//! `uvm/uvm_meter.c` (M7).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The fork counters are atomics: `fork1` bumps them under the kernel lock in C, which
//!   this kernel does not have yet.
