//! `<sys/extent.h>`: the general purpose extent manager's types and flags (`extent(9)`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/extent.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! An extent is a range of unsigned numbers (bus numbers, I/O ports, memory addresses) and
//! the list of regions allocated in it, kept sorted. The functions are `kern/subr_extent.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `u_long` is `u64` (LP64 on both architectures).
//! - The descriptors are `#[repr(C)]` structures of `Cell`s, changed through shared
//!   references as the C changes them through pointers; the extent has no lock, its users
//!   serialize (autoconfiguration under the kernel lock), as in C.
//! - `ex_name` is a byte string (`&'static [u8]`), printed without its NUL.
//! - The `extent_alloc` and `extent_alloc_with_descr` macros are functions in
//!   `subr_extent.rs`; the prototypes are that file's.
