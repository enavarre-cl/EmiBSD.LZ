/* <CODE> */
//! Minimal device structures: `<sys/device.h>`, the types of autoconfiguration
//! (`autoconf(9)`, `config_attach(9)`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/device.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A driver is a [`Cfdriver`] (its name, class and array of attached units) plus one
//! [`Cfattach`] per bus it attaches to (its softc size and its match, attach, detach and
//! activate functions). `config(8)` would generate the [`Cfdata`] table that says which driver
//! may attach where; here each architecture writes it by hand (`sys/arch/<arch>/conf/ioconf.rs`,
//! reached through `machine::autoconf`). The functions declared by the header live where the C
//! defines them: `kern/subr_autoconf.rs` (`config_*`, `device_*`) and the machine's
//! `autoconf.rs` (`device_register`).
//!
//! A softc is a `#[repr(C)]` struct whose first field is the [`Device`], allocated by
//! `config_make_softc` with `malloc(ca_devsize, M_DEVBUF, M_NOWAIT|M_ZERO)` as in C; its type
//! implements [`Softc`] and the driver recovers it from the `&Device` it is handed with
//! [`Device::softc`], the C's `(struct foo_softc *)self`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Function pointers are Rust `fn` types; the `void *aux` of attach arguments stays an
//!   untyped pointer (`*mut c_void`) that each bus's children cast back to the bus's attach
//!   arguments, as in C. The `void *match` of `cfmatch_t`/`cfscan_t`, which is a `cfdata`
//!   or, below an indirect (`CD_INDIRECT`) parent, a preallocated softc, is the enum
//!   [`CfMatch`].
//! - `cfdata[]` and `cfroots[]` are slices without the C's terminating entry (a NULL
//!   `cf_driver`, a `-1` root); `cf_parents` and `cf_loc` are slices too. `config(8)`'s free
//!   `{0}` slots are [`Cfdata::free`] entries, whose attachment and driver are the statics
//!   [`CFATTACH_NULL`] and [`CFDRIVER_NULL`] instead of NULL.
//! - `cd_devs` holds `Option<NonNull<Device>>` slots (the C's `void *`), read through
//!   [`Cfdriver::cd_dev`]; `dv_ref` is atomic, as `atomic_inc_int` makes it in C.
//! - Fields autoconfiguration changes after boot (`cf_unit`, `cf_fstate`, `cd_devs`,
//!   `cd_ndevs`, every `struct device` member) are `Cell`s: the C changes them under the
//!   kernel lock, which a single CPU without preemption provides here.
//! - The prototypes of the suspend/resume (`request_sleep`, `sleep_state`, ...), root-device
//!   (`findblkmajor`, `setroot`, `parsedisk`, ...) and `loadfirmware` functions belong to files
//!   that are not ported (`subr_suspend.c`, `kern/subr_disk.c`, `dev/firmload.c`); only their
//!   types and constants are here.
