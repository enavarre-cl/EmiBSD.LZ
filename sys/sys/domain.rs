//! Structure per communications domain: `<sys/domain.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/domain.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A domain is an address family (`AF_INET`, `AF_ROUTE`, ...) with its table of protocols and
//! the routing table's view of its addresses (`dom_rtoffset`, `dom_maxplen`).
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `dom_protosw` and `dom_protoswNPROTOSW` (the table and one past its end) are one slice.
//! - `dom_name` is a byte string without the NUL.
//! - `domaininit` and `domains[]` are `kern/uipc_domain.rs`'s, which defines them; the domains
//!   themselves (`inetdomain`, `routedomain`, ...) are their protocol files' statics, as the
//!   C's `extern` declarations name them. `socklen_t` is `crate::sys::types::Socklen`.
//! - `dom_dispose` takes `Option<&'static Mbuf>`: `sorele` and `sorflush` hand it the
//!   receive buffer's chain, NULL when the buffer is empty.
