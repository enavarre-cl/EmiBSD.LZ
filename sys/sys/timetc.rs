/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/timetc.h>`: the timecounter interface between the hardware which implements a
//! timecounter and the MI code which uses this to keep track of time.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/timetc.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M5 ports `struct timecounter`, `struct timekeep` and
//! `TK_VERSION`; the functions are in `kern/kern_tc.rs`, with `tc_lock` (`TC_LOCK`, the C's
//! `extern`). `timekeep_object` (the page shared with userland, M6) is not here.
//!
//! A timecounter is a binary counter which has two properties:
//! - it runs at a fixed, known frequency.
//! - it has sufficient bits to not roll over in less than approximately
//!   max(2 msec, 2/HZ seconds). (The value 2 here is really 1 + delta, for some
//!   indeterminate value of delta.)
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The fields a driver fills in after its static initialiser (`tc_frequency`, `tc_priv`,
//!   `tc_get_timecount`, `tc_user`, `tc_name`: `acpitimer` and `acpihpet` name theirs after
//!   their device) and the ones `tc_init`/`tc_reset_quality` write are `Cell`s, so a
//!   `static` timecounter is registered through `&'static`.
//! - `tc_priv` is an opaque pointer, as in C; the driver casts it back.
