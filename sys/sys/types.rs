/* <CODE> */
//! Kernel-wide scalar types: `<sys/types.h>` together with `<sys/_types.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/types.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/sys/_types.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Widths are those of `<machine/_types.h>` on amd64 and arm64, which agree (both are LP64).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `<sys/_types.h>` is folded in: its `__name_t` typedefs exist only for namespace hygiene,
//!   which Rust modules provide. Each `name_t` becomes one CamelCase alias without the `_t`
//!   (`pid_t` → [`Pid`]); see `docs/C_TO_RUST.md`.
//! - `u_char`, `u_short`, `u_int`, `u_long`, the Sys V `unchar`/`ushort`/`uint`/`ulong`, the
//!   exact-width `[u_]intN_t` and `quad_t`/`u_quad_t` are Rust primitives (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`,
//!   `u64`, `i64`, ...); no aliases are declared.
//! - `caddr_t` is `&[u8]`/`&mut [u8]` (or `NonNull<u8>` at ABI edges); `size_t`/`ssize_t` are
//!   `usize`/`isize`; `bool`, `true`, `false` are Rust's.
//! - `vaddr_t`, `paddr_t`, `vsize_t`, `psize_t` are the newtypes [`Vaddr`], [`Paddr`], [`Vsize`],
//!   [`Psize`], so the compiler keeps virtual and physical addresses apart.
//! - `major`, `minor`, `makedev` are `const fn`s over [`Dev`].
//! - `__mbstate_t`, the userland prototypes (`lseek`, `ftruncate`, `truncate`) and the forward
//!   `struct` declarations have no kernel-side counterpart.
//! - `label_t` is machine-dependent and lives in `arch/<arch>/include/_types.rs`.
