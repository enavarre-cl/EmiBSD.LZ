/* <CODE> */
//! Sockets: types, address families, options and the generic socket address,
//! `<sys/socket.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/socket.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The structures cross the user/kernel boundary, so they are `#[repr(C)]` with the C's field
//! order, and their LP64 sizes are checked at compile time. Address families are
//! [`SaFamily`] (`sa_family_t`, the type of `sa_family`), which is what the network code
//! compares them with; the other constants are `i32`, the `int` the system calls take.
//!
//! Status: `wip`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `msg_iov` is a `*mut c_void` until `<sys/uio.h>` (`struct iovec`) is ported.
//! - `CTL_NET_NAMES`, `CTL_NET_RT_NAMES`, `CTL_NET_UNIX_NAMES`, `CTL_NET_UNIX_PROTO_NAMES`,
//!   `CTL_NET_LINK_NAMES`, `CTL_NET_LINK_IFRXQ_NAMES`, `CTL_NET_KEY_NAMES`,
//!   `CTL_NET_BPF_NAMES` and `CTL_NET_PFLOW_NAMES` (`struct ctlname` tables) come with
//!   `<sys/sysctl.h>`.
//! - `CMSG_DATA`, `CMSG_FIRSTHDR` and `CMSG_NXTHDR` work on raw pointers, as the C does on
//!   `msg_control`: the first two only compute addresses and are safe; [`cmsg_nxthdr`] reads
//!   `cmsg_len` and is `unsafe`. `CMSG_ALIGN`, `CMSG_LEN` and `CMSG_SPACE` are `const fn`s.
//! - `sstosa` is a pointer cast (see `docs/C_TO_RUST.md`); `SA_LEN(x)` is `x.sa_len`.
//! - The userland prototypes (`socket`, `bind`, ...) have no kernel counterpart; the system
//!   calls come with `uipc_syscalls.c`.
