/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/lockf.h>`: the interface of the advisory record locks, `lf_init`, `lf_advlock` and
//! `lf_purgelocks`, over an opaque `struct lockf_state`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/lockf.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The header only forward-declares `struct lockf_state`; `vfs_lockf.c` defines it, so the
//!   type and the functions live in `kern/vfs_lockf.rs` and are re-exported here.
//! - `struct lockf_state **` (the slot a vnode or an inode keeps, `v_speclockf`, `i_lockf`)
//!   is [`LockfStateSlot`], a `Cell` holding `Option<&'static LockfState>`.

pub use crate::kern::vfs_lockf::{LockfState, LockfStateSlot, lf_advlock, lf_init, lf_purgelocks};
