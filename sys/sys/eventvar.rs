/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/eventvar.h>`: `struct kqueue`, the kernel side of a `kqueue(2)` descriptor (and of a
//! thread's `select(2)`/`poll(2)` queue, `p_kq`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/eventvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A kqueue is a reference-counted pool item (`kqueue_pool`, `kern_event.rs`): handed out
//! as `&'static Kqueue` by `kqueue_alloc`, given back by `KQRELE` on its last reference (the
//! `crget`/`crfree` idiom of `docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members `kq_lock` guards (`[q]`) are `Cell`s; `kq_knlist` and `kq_knhash` stay raw
//!   pointers to `malloc(M_KEVENT)` arrays of [`Knlist`] heads with their sizes, as in C,
//!   because `kqueue_expand_list` swaps the table for a bigger one; they are read through
//!   the bounds-checked [`Kqueue::knlist`] and [`Kqueue::knhash`].
//! - `kq_knhashmask` is `u64` (the C's `u_long`).
