/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/pipe.h>`: the per-direction pipe structure, `struct pipe`, its circular buffer
//! `struct pipebuf`, the buffer sizes and the `PIPE_*` state bits.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/pipe.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Two `struct pipe`s, one per direction, live in one `struct pipe_pair` (a pool item defined
//! by `kern/sys_pipe.c`, here `kern::sys_pipe::PipePair`) and share its rwlock. A pipe is
//! reached through its file's `f_data` for as long as the file is open, and through its
//! peer's `pipe_peer` until it is destroyed; the pair goes back to the pool when its second
//! side is destroyed.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members the C guards with `pipe_lock` (`[p]`) are `Cell`s; `pipe_lock`,
//!   `pipe_peer` and `pipe_pair` are raw pointers into the pair (`Cell<*const T>`), read
//!   through [`Pipe::lock`] and the functions of `sys_pipe.c`.
//! - `struct pipebuf`'s member `in` is a Rust keyword: it is the raw identifier `r#in`.
//! - `PIPE_SIZE` and `BIG_PIPE_SIZE` are `usize` (they size `km_alloc` and compare with
//!   `uio_resid`); the C's `#ifndef` overrides are not configurable.
