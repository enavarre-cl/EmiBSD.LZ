//! `<sys/exec_script.h>`: the magic and the header size of interpreted (`#!`) scripts.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/exec_script.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The kernel half, `exec_script_makecmds`, is in `sys/kern/exec_script.rs`, the module of
//! `exec_script.c`, which the exec switch (`kern_exec.rs`) names.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `EXEC_SCRIPT_MAGIC` is a byte string (`b"#!"`), compared against the header's bytes.
