/* <CODE> */
//! `<sys/mutex.h>`: the mutex. A mutex is owned by a cpu, non-recursive, spinning, and not
//! providing mutual exclusion between processes, only cpus.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/mutex.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports `struct mutex` (the machine-independent one: both
//! architectures' `<machine/mutex.h>` say `__USE_MI_MUTEX`), `MUTEX_INITIALIZER`,
//! `mtx_curcpu`, `mtx_owner`, `mtx_owned`, `MUTEX_ASSERT_LOCKED`/`UNLOCKED` and the `MTX_*`
//! flags. `WITNESS` (`lock_object`, `MTX_LO_INITIALIZER`) is not configured. The functions
//! live in `kern/kern_lock.rs`. M11a: `__MUTEX_IPL(ipl)` raises to at least `IPL_MPFLOOR` with
//! `MULTIPROCESSOR`, as in the C. M11c: `struct db_mutex` and `DB_MUTEX_INITIALIZER` (`DDB`,
//! always configured here).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The fields are an atomic and `Cell`s, so a `static` mutex is entered through `&`.
//! - `db_mutex`'s owner is the owning CPU as `mtx_curcpu()` gives it (an `AtomicUsize`, 0 when
//!   free), like `struct mutex`'s, instead of a `struct cpu_info *volatile`.
