//! `<sys/ucred.h>`: credentials.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/ucred.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. Milestone M5 ports `struct ucred` and `struct xucred` (the process
//! structures point at one); `NOCRED` and `FSCRED` come with `kern_prot.c`, whose module
//! (`kern/kern_prot.rs`) holds the functions this header declares (`crget`, `crhold`,
//! `crfree`, `crset`, `crcopy`, `crdup`, `crfromxucred`, `suser`, `suser_ucred`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members after `cr_refcnt` are `Cell`s: a credential is filled in (`crset`, exec's
//!   `crcopy`) through the same shared pointer the processes hold, while it is unshared.
//! - `cr_startcopy` (the `#define` naming where `crset` starts copying) is a comment: `crset`
//!   copies the members by name.
