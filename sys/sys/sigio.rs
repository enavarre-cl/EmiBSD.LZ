//! `<sys/sigio.h>`: the registration of a process or process group to receive `SIGIO`/
//! `SIGURG` for a file.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/sigio.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (with `kern_sig.c`, which implements the functions it declares).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The union `sio_u` (`sio_proc` or `sio_pgrp`, chosen by the sign of `sio_pgid`) is two
//!   side-by-side pointer fields; the one the sign does not select stays null.
