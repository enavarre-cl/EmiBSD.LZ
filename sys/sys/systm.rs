//! `<sys/systm.h>`: the kernel's global declarations.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/systm.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 ports `physmem`; M5 adds `cold`, `safepri` and the sleep
//! limits `INFSLP`/`MAXTSLP`; M6 `struct sysent`, `sy_call_t`, `SY_NOLOCK` and `SCARG`; M7b
//! the net lock macros (`NET_LOCK` .. `NET_ASSERT_LOCKED_EXCLUSIVE`) over `netlock`; M11a the
//! kernel lock macros (`KERNEL_LOCK_INIT` .. `KERNEL_ASSERT_UNLOCKED`) as functions. The
//! hostname and boot-time globals, the `panic`/`printf` prototypes (already in
//! `kern/subr_prf.rs`) and the rest arrive with their files. `tsleep`/`wakeup` are in
//! `kern/kern_synch.rs`; the `copyin`/`copyout` family is `machine::copy`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `physmem`, `cold` and `safepri` are defined here (the C defines each in every
//!   `machdep.c`/`autoconf.c` and declares them here), so generic code names them without an
//!   architecture path; the `machdep`s and `cpu_configure` fill them.
//! - `NET_LOCK()` and friends are functions (`net_lock()`); the assertions take the caller's
//!   name, which the C's macros take from `__func__`. `netlock` itself is defined in
//!   `net/if_.rs`, where `net/if.c` defines it.
//! - `mountroot` (declared here, defined NULL in `conf/swapgeneric.c` and pointed at the
//!   root file system's mount routine by `setroot`, `subr_disk.c`) is a `StaticCell` of an
//!   `Option<fn() -> Result<(), Errno>>`, defined here like `cold`; nothing sets it until a
//!   disk driver and a file system exist (stage 2).
//! - `sy_call_t` returns `Result<(), Errno>` with the two return registers as an out
//!   parameter; `SCARG(uap, k)` is `sysargs::<T>(v).k.get()` (`sys/syscallargs.rs`).
