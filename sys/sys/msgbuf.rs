/* <CODE> */
//! The kernel message buffer that `dmesg(8)` reads: `<sys/msgbuf.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/msgbuf.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A `struct msgbuf` is laid over a memory area the machine code chooses (it survives a warm
//! reboot); the header is followed by `msg_bufs` bytes of ring buffer. The functions that fill
//! and read it are in `kern/subr_log.rs`.
//!
//! Locking, as in the C: `I` immutable after creation, `L` `log_mtx`, `Lw` `log_mtx` for
//! writing (`LOG_MTX`, `kern/subr_log.rs`, since M11e).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `msg_bufc[1]` (a flexible array in disguise) is a real unsized tail; [`Msgbuf::from_raw`]
//!   lays the structure over a byte area, which is what the C cast does.
