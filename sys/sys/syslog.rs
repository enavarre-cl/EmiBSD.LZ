//! Priorities and facilities of the system log: `<sys/syslog.h>`, as the kernel sees it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/syslog.h @ 3ce1f3f79392

//! Priorities and facilities are encoded into one `int`: the bottom 3 bits are the priority

//! `logwakeup` in `kern/subr_log.rs`.

//! - `struct syslog_data`, the `SYSLOG_NAMES` tables and the userland prototypes are not
