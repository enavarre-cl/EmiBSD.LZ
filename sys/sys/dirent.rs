//! `<sys/dirent.h>`: `struct dirent`, the format of the directory entries `getdents(2)`
//! returns, the `DT_*` file types and the record-size macros.
//!
//! A directory entry has a `struct dirent` at the front of it, containing its inode number,
//! the length of the entry, and the length of the name contained in the entry. These are
//! followed by the name padded to an 8 byte boundary with null bytes. All names are
//! guaranteed null terminated. The maximum length of a name in a directory is `MAXNAMLEN`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/dirent.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `IFTODT`, `DTTOIF`, `DIRENT_RECSIZE` and `DIRENT_SIZE` are `const fn`s with lowercase
//!   names; `dirent_size` takes the structure.
//! - [`Dirent::from_bytes`] reads an entry out of a directory buffer (what the C does by
//!   casting a `char *` into it); the name stays in the buffer.
