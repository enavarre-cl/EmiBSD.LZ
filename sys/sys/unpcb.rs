/* <CODE> */
//! Protocol control block for an active instance of a UNIX internal protocol:
//! `<sys/unpcb.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/sys/unpcb.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A socket may be associated with a vnode in the file system. If so, the `unp_vnode`
//! pointer holds a reference count to this vnode, which should be `vrele`'d when the socket
//! goes away.
//!
//! A socket may be connected to another socket, in which case the control block of the
//! socket to which it is connected is given by `unp_conn`.
//!
//! A socket may be referenced by a number of sockets (e.g. several sockets may be connected
//! to a datagram socket.) These sockets are in a linked list starting with `unp_refs`,
//! linked through `unp_nextref` and null-terminated. Note that a socket may be referenced by
//! a number of other sockets and may also reference a socket (not necessarily one which is
//! referencing it). This generates the need for `unp_refs` and `unp_nextref` to be separate
//! fields.
//!
//! Stream sockets keep copies of receive sockbuf `sb_cc` and `sb_mbcnt` so that changes in
//! the sockbuf may be computed to modify back pressure on the sender accordingly.
//!
//! Locks used to protect struct members: \[I\] immutable after creation, \[G\]
//! `unp_gc_lock`, \[s\] socket lock.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - An `Unpcb` is an `unpcb_pool` item handed around as `&'static Unpcb` (valid until
//!   `unp_detach` gives it back); its links to other control blocks, the vnode, the file and
//!   the address mbuf are `Cell<Option<&'static T>>`, the counters `Cell`s.
//! - `struct fdpass` lives inside control mbufs, so it keeps the C layout: `fp` is a raw
//!   `*const File` the internalized message holds a reference through.
//! - `sotounpcb(so)` returns `Option<&'static Unpcb>` (the C's NULL `so_pcb` is `None`).
//! - The `pr_usrreqs` tables and the prototypes are `kern/uipc_usrreq.rs`'s.
