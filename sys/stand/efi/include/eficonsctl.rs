/* <CODE> */
//! EFI console control protocol (the Apple and Intel text/graphics screen switch).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/stand/efi/include/eficonsctl.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The header carries the FreeBSD tag on its 33rd line, after its licence; the tag is the
//! first line of this file, as the other headers have it. The routine descriptions
//! (`/*++ ... --*/`) after each prototype are in the doc comments below.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `EFI_CONSOLE_CONTROL_PROTOCOL` is `EfiConsoleControlProtocol`;
//!   `EFI_CONSOLE_CONTROL_SCREEN_MODE` is a `u32` alias plus one constant per enumerator.
//! - `extern EFI_GUID gEfiConsoleControlProtocolGuid` is not ported: nothing in the tree
//!   defines it (the GUID is the macro), and a Rust `extern` static would be an unresolved
//!   symbol. The GUID macro is the `EfiGuid` constant `EFI_CONSOLE_CONTROL_PROTOCOL_GUID`.
//! - `This` is `*mut EfiConsoleControlProtocol`; the `OPTIONAL` arguments of `GetMode` are raw
//!   pointers that may be null.

#![allow(non_snake_case, non_upper_case_globals, non_camel_case_types)]
// EFI names are the specification's (GopUgaExists, EfiConsoleControlScreenText, ...), kept verbatim for grep-ability
