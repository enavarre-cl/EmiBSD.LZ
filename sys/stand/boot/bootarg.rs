/* <CODE> */
//! The boot arguments: the list of typed records (`bootarg_t`) a boot program collects and
//! copies out for the kernel, which walks them until `BOOTARG_END`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/stand/boot/bootarg.c @ 3ce1f3f79392, sys/stand/boot/bootarg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The kernel reads the records in its own layout: `makebootargs` writes the native one
//! (`int ba_type; size_t ba_size; bootarg_t *ba_next; int ba_arg[]`, 64-bit: 28 bytes of
//! header), `makebootargs32` the 32-bit one amd64's kernel is handed by the 32-bit entry
//! (`int ba_type; int ba_size; int ba_nextX; char ba_arg[]`: 12 bytes of header, records
//! packed). `ba_size` covers the header and the argument; `ba_next` is not meaningful in the
//! copy. The list is copied newest first, as the C prepends.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The list (`bootarg_list`, `alloc`ed records linked by `ba_next`) is a `Vec` of
//!   [`Bootarg`] in [`BOOTARG_LIST`], newest last; the copies are built byte by byte in the
//!   C's layouts. `addbootarg` takes the argument as bytes.
//! - `extern void *bootargv; extern int bootargc; extern bootarg_t *bootargp` are the
//!   kernel's (A2) and are not declared here.
