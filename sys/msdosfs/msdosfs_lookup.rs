//! Directory operations of the msdos file system: `msdosfs_lookup` (find a name in a
//! directory, or the place a new entry for it would go), `createde` (write a directory entry,
//! with its Win95 long name entries), `dosdirempty`, `doscheckpath` (keep a rename from
//! moving a directory below itself), `readep`/`readde` (read the block of a directory entry),
//! `removede` (delete an entry and its long name entries) and `uniqdosname` (make a short
//! name no other entry has).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/msdosfs/msdosfs_lookup.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! When a directory is searched, the blocks holding its entries are read and examined. The
//! entries hold what an inode holds in a unix file system, so part of a directory's contents
//! may also be in memory-resident denodes. A process that changes a directory must therefore
//! own the disk block of the entry first (`bread`/`brelse` give that exclusivity), then
//! update the block and the denode, then write the block, so that the blocks and the denodes
//! agree.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - A `struct direntry *` into a buffer is the entry's offset in the buffer's bytes, viewed
//!   with `Direntry::at`/`at_mut` (`Winentry` for a long name entry at the same offset);
//!   `ep--` subtracts the entry size. `removede` checks that it is not at the start of the
//!   block before it steps back, where the C steps back and then does not look at the entry.
//! - The directory search of `msdosfs_lookup` (up to its `found`/`foundroot`/`notfound`
//!   labels) is the private `msdosfs_lookup_search`, which returns where it ended; the
//!   function then does what the labels' code does. The host tests run the search alone,
//!   since getting a denode needs the vnode operations of `msdosfs_vnops.c`.
//! - `readep` and `readde` return the busy buffer and the offset of the entry in its data
//!   (the C's `bptoep`), where the C fills `*bpp` and `*epp`; on error the buffer is already
//!   released (the C sets `*bpp = NULL`).
//! - `createde` takes the caller's `depp` as `Option<&mut Option<&'static Denode>>` (the C's
//!   NULL is `None`) and sets it to `None` when `deget` fails, as `deget` NULLs it in the C.
//! - `dosdirempty` returns `bool` (the C's 1 and 0).
//! - `doscheckpath`'s `DIAGNOSTIC` check that both denodes are on one file system is behind
//!   feature `diagnostic`.
//! - The `MSDOSFS_DEBUG` `printf`s are left out: the option is not in GENERIC and has no
//!   feature here.
