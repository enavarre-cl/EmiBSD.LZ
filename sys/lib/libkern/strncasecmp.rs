//! `strncasecmp(3)`: compare at most `n` bytes of two strings, ignoring ASCII case.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/strncasecmp.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Operates on byte slices: a string ends at its first NUL or at the end of its slice,
//!   whichever comes first (the C reads to the NUL). The result keeps the C's sign and value:
//!   the difference of the first differing bytes after case folding.

/// Compares `s1` and `s2` over at most `n` bytes, folding `A`-`Z` onto `a`-`z` when the two
/// bytes differ; negative, zero or positive as `s1` sorts before, with or after `s2`.
pub fn strncasecmp(s1: &[u8], s2: &[u8], n: usize) -> i32 {
    let byte = |s: &[u8], i: usize| s.get(i).copied().unwrap_or(0);

    for i in 0..n {
        let mut c1 = byte(s1, i);
        let mut c2 = byte(s2, i);
