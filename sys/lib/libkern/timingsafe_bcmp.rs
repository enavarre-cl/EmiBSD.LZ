//! `timingsafe_bcmp(3)`: constant-time byte comparison.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/timingsafe_bcmp.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Takes two slices instead of two pointers and a length. The C caller guarantees both buffers
//!   hold `n` bytes; here `n` is the shorter length and a length mismatch counts as a difference.
//!   Lengths are not secret, so folding them in costs nothing.
//! - Returns `bool` for the C `int`: `true` where C returns 1 (the buffers differ).

/// Compares `b1` and `b2` in time that depends only on their lengths, never on their contents.
/// Returns `true` if they differ (C returns 1), `false` if they are identical (C returns 0).
pub fn timingsafe_bcmp(b1: &[u8], b2: &[u8]) -> bool {
    let n = b1.len().min(b2.len());
    let mut ret: u8 = 0;
    for (x, y) in b1[..n].iter().zip(&b2[..n]) {
        ret |= x ^ y;
    }
    (ret != 0) | (b1.len() != b2.len())
