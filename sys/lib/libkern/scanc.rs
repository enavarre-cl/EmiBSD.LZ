//! `scanc(9)`: scan a byte string for the first byte whose class, looked up in a table,
//! shares a bit with a mask.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/scanc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Operates on a byte slice: the C's `size` and `cp` are `cp.len()` and `cp`, and the
//!   count returned is a `usize`. The table is `&[u8; 256]`, so every byte has a class and
//!   the lookup cannot go out of bounds.

/// The number of bytes left in `cp` from the first one whose `table` entry has a bit of
/// `mask` set (that byte included); 0 when there is none.
pub fn scanc(cp: &[u8], table: &[u8; 256], mask: u8) -> usize {
    let skipped = cp
        .iter()
        .position(|&c| table[usize::from(c)] & mask != 0)
        .unwrap_or(cp.len());
    cp.len() - skipped
