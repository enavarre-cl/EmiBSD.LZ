//! `explicit_bzero(3)`: zero a buffer in a way the compiler cannot remove.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/explicit_bzero.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The C version calls `memset` and then a weak, empty `__explicit_bzero_hook` so that the
//! optimizer cannot prove the stores dead. Rust has no weak symbols on stable, so each byte is
//! stored with `write_volatile`, which the optimizer must keep.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - No `__explicit_bzero_hook`; volatile stores give the same guarantee.
//! - Takes a slice; the length is `buf.len()`.

/// Overwrites `buf` with zeros. The stores are volatile, so they survive even when the buffer is
/// never read again (the usual case for a secret about to be freed).
pub fn explicit_bzero(buf: &mut [u8]) {
    for b in buf.iter_mut() {
        // SAFETY: `b` is a valid, aligned, exclusively borrowed `u8` for the duration of the
        // write; a volatile store through it is sound.
        unsafe { core::ptr::write_volatile(b, 0) };
    }
