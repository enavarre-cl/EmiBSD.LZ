//! `getsn`: read a line from the console, with echo and simple editing.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/getsn.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The kernel's few interactive prompts read their answers with it: `boot -c`'s `UKC>`
//! (`kern/subr_userconf.c`) and the root device question of `boot -a`. Each key is read with
//! `cngetc` and echoed; backspace and DEL erase the last character, `^U` the whole line, a tab
//! is a space, and a key that does not fit or is a control character rings the bell. Return or
//! newline ends the line, which is NUL-terminated in the buffer.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - This crate is a leaf (it cannot call into `bsd`), so the console is the [`GetsnCons`]
//!   argument: its `cngetc` is the C's `cngetc()` and its `cnputs` the C's `printf` of the
//!   echo, the bell and the erase sequence.
//! - The buffer is a slice (`size` is its length). A zero-length buffer cannot hold even the
//!   terminating NUL: every key rings the bell and the line ends without storing anything,
//!   where the C would write one byte past it.

/// The console `getsn` reads keys from and echoes to.
pub trait GetsnCons {
    /// `cngetc()`: the next key, waiting for it.
    fn cngetc(&mut self) -> i32;

    /// `printf("%s", s)`: writes the bytes to the console.

/// length without the NUL.
