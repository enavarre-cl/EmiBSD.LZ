//! `skpc`: skip the leading bytes of a string that equal a given byte.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/skpc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The fast file system's inode allocator uses it to skip the all-used bytes (`0xff`) of a
//! cylinder group's inode map (`ffs_nodealloccg`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The string is a slice (`size` is its length); `mask` is the byte itself, as the C's
//!   `(u_char)mask` cast makes it.

/// The number of bytes left in `cp` from the first byte that is not `mask`; 0 when every
/// byte is `mask`.
pub fn skpc(mask: u8, cp: &[u8]) -> usize {
    match cp.iter().position(|&c| c != mask) {
        Some(i) => cp.len() - i,
        None => 0,
    }
