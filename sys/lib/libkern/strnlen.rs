//! `strnlen(3)`: bounded string length.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libkern/strnlen.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Operates on a byte slice: the scan stops at the first NUL, at `maxlen`, or at the end of
//!   the slice, whichever comes first. The C version has no way to know the slice end.

/// The length of the string in `s`, counting at most `maxlen` bytes.
