//! Space allocation and freeing routines for use by zlib routines in the kernel.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libz/zopenbsd.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The C's `zcalloc` is `mallocarray(items, size, M_DEVBUF, M_NOWAIT)`: it may fail, and zlib
//! turns the failure into `Z_MEM_ERROR`. The Rust functions keep that: they allocate through
//! the global allocator (malloc(9) in the kernel, `sys/kern/rust_alloc.rs`) and return `None`
//! instead of aborting when it has no memory. They also stand for zutil.h's `ZALLOC`, `ZFREE`
//! and `TRY_FREE`, which call `zcalloc`/`zcfree` through the stream.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `zcalloc` returns a typed, zero-filled `Vec<T>` of `items` elements (the C returns
//!   uninitialised memory; zlib zeroes what it reads before writing it, so zeroing is only
//!   safer); [`zcalloc_box`] allocates one value, for the stream states. `M_DEVBUF` has no
//!   counterpart: the global allocator has one malloc type.
//! - `zcfree` drops what `zcalloc` returned; the size the C passes to free(9) is the `Vec`'s.
