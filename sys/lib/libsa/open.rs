//! The open file table and `open()`, which finds the device and then the file system.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/open.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! libsa is built here as efiboot builds it, with `__INTERNAL_LIBSA_CREAD`: this `open` is
//! [`oopen`], and `cread.rs`'s `open` wraps it with gzip decompression.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `files[]` is the [`StaticCell`] [`FILES`]; [`files`] hands it out to libsa's entry
//!   points, one at a time.
//! - A descriptor is a `usize` index and failure an `Err` (the C's -1 with `errno` set; the
//!   error is also stored in `errno`, which boot(8) prints). The file name is a byte slice
//!   the file systems copy what they need from, where the C passes a pointer they write NULs
//!   into and restore.
