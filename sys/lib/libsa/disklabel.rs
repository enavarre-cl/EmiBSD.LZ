//! `getdisklabel()`: find and check the disk label in a sector.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/disklabel.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Only the old smaller "skinny" label, which has 16 partitions, is read: the C carves
//! `struct disklabel` with `offsetof(struct disklabel, d_partitions[MAXPARTITIONS16])`; the
//! "fat" label with 52 partitions is left for later, as in C.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The message is an `Err(&'static str)` (the C returns it, or NULL for success). The
//!   candidate labels are copied out of the sector before they are checked, as the sector
//!   bytes have no alignment for Rust; the C reads them in place.
