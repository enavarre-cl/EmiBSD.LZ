/* <CODE> */
//! `saerrno.h`: the error numbers of the standalone library, `<sys/errno.h>`'s and the
//! special standalone ones (`EADAPT` .. `EHER`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/saerrno.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The C's `int` error numbers are an `Errno` newtype over `i32` rather than the kernel's
//!   `enum`: libsa's errors are open-ended, as in C. A device's open routine may return a
//!   status that is no error number (efiboot's `espopen` and `tftpopen` return 1, "not
//!   mine"), `open()` passes it on, and boot(8) then compares `errno` with `EPERM`, which is 1.
//!   `ufs_readdir` returns -1 at the end of a directory, which `readdir()` passes on too.
//! - `extern int errno` is [`ERRNO`](crate::dev::ERRNO), defined in `dev.rs` as `dev.c`
//!   defines it.
//! - Only the `<sys/errno.h>` numbers libsa and the boot programs use are declared here; the
//!   kernel's `sys/sys/errno.rs` has them all.

/// An error number: one of `<sys/errno.h>`'s, a standalone one, or a status a device routine
/// returned.
