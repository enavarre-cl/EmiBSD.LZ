/*
 * Scaled down version of printf(3).
 *
 * One additional format:
 *
 * The format %b is supported to decode error registers.
 * Its usage is:
 *
 *	printf("reg=%b\n", regval, "<base><arg>*");
 *
 * where <base> is the output base expressed as a control character, e.g.
 * \10 gives octal; \20 gives hex.  Each arg is a sequence of characters,
 * the first of which gives the bit number to be inspected (origin 1), and
 * the next characters (up to a control character, i.e. a character <= 32),
 * give the name of the register.  Thus:
 *
 *	printf("reg=%b\n", 3, "\10\2BITTWO\1BITONE\n");
 *
 * would produce output:
 *
 *	reg=3<BITTWO,BITONE>

//! `printf()` on the console, and `twiddle()`, the spinning progress mark.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/printf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `printf(fmt, ...)` is the [`printf!`](crate::printf!) macro over Rust format strings
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`: printf(9) becomes `kprintf!`; libsa does the same). `kdoprnt`'s
//!   conversions map to format specs: `%d`/`%u`/`%ld` to `{}`, `%x`/`%lx`/`%llx` to `{:x}`,
//!   `%08lx` to `{:08x}`, `%c` to a `char`, `%s` of a NUL-terminated byte string to
//!   [`Str`]. `%b` (a value and its bit names) has no caller in the boot programs ported
//!   here; when one comes it gets a `Display` helper as the kernel's `Bitmask`.
//! - `kdoprnt`, `kprintn` and `kprintn64` are `core::fmt`; the output still goes byte by byte
//!   through `putchar()`, so the console sees what the C sends (characters above U+00FF,
//!   which byte strings never produce, become `?`).
