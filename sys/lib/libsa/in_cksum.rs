//! `in_cksum()`: the Internet checksum of the IP and UDP headers.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/in_cksum.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The bytes are a slice. The C sums 16-bit words through a `u_short` load when the
//!   buffer is even-aligned and byte by byte otherwise; both sum the big-endian words, which
//!   is what this does whatever the alignment.

/// `in_cksum(p, l)`: the checksum of `p`, as the C returns it: the one's complement of the
/// one's complement sum, in network order (stored as is, it is the bytes of the header
/// field). 0 over data that carry their own valid checksum.
///
/// This routine is very heavily used in the network code and should be modified for each
/// CPU to be as fast as possible. In particular, it should not be this one.
