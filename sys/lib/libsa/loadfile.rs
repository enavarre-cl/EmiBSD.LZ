/* <CODE> */
//! `loadfile()`: open a kernel, recognise its ELF class and load it (see `loadfile_elf.rs`),
//! leaving the positions of what it loaded in `marks`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/loadfile.c @ 3ce1f3f79392, sys/lib/libsa/loadfile.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Compiled as on amd64 (`<machine/loadfile_machdep.h>`): `BOOT_ELF`, `BOOT_ELF32` and
//! `BOOT_ELF64`, so a 32-bit and a 64-bit ELF loader are both built and the header's class
//! picks one; `LOADADDR` is the program's ([`SaConf::loadaddr`](crate::stand::SaConf)),
//! `WARN` prints the message and `strerror(errno)`, `PROGRESS` prints.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The descriptor is an `Ok`, failure an `Err` with the error number (the C's -1, `errno`
//!   also set). `marks` is a `[u64; MARK_MAX]`.
//! - `loadfile` is an `unsafe fn`: it writes the kernel wherever the program's `LOADADDR`
//!   says, which only the program can vouch for (the C has the same contract, unwritten).
