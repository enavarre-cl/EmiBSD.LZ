//! `strtol()`: a string to a `long`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/strtol.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Ignores `locale' stuff. Assumes that the upper and lower case alphabets and digits are
//! each contiguous. libsa's version skips every control character and blank in front of the
//! number (not only `isspace`), and saturates at `LONG_MIN`/`LONG_MAX` on overflow.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The string is a byte slice, its end standing for the NUL; `endptr` is the index
//!   returned beside the value (the C's `*endptr - nptr`).

/// `strtol(nptr, &endptr, base)`: the value and the index where the number ended (0 if
/// there was none).
