//! The standalone console: pick the best console of `constab[]` and do character I/O on it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/cons.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `constab[]` is the program's [`SaConf::constab`](crate::stand::SaConf); `cn_tab`, which
//!   the program's `conf.c` defines and points at `constab[0]`, is [`CN_TAB`] here, an index
//!   into it (`usize::MAX` for the C's NULL), starting at 0 as in C.
