/* <CODE> */
//! The Ethernet layer of the standalone network code: send a packet with an Ethernet
//! header in front, receive one addressed to us or to the broadcast address.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/ether.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - A packet is a buffer and the offset of its data (`net.rs`); the header goes in the 14
//!   bytes in front of the data, and a buffer without them is `EINVAL` where the C writes
//!   before its pointer.
//! - `readether` returns the Ethernet type with the length, where the C stores it through
//!   its fifth argument. A driver that claims more bytes than the buffer holds is taken at
//!   the buffer's length.
//! - `ether_sprintf()` returns the text by value ([`NetStr`]) where the C returns its
//!   `static char etherbuf[]`.
//! - The `ETHER_DEBUG` messages are not ported: no efiboot Makefile defines it.
