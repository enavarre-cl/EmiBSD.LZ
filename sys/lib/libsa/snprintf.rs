//! `snprintf()`: format into a buffer.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/snprintf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `snprintf(buf, len, fmt, ...)` is the [`snprintf!`](crate::snprintf!) macro over Rust
//!   format strings (see `printf.rs`); `sputchar`'s `sbuf`/`sbuf_end` globals are the state of
//!   a local writer. The result is the C's: at most `len - 1` bytes and a NUL, and the length
//!   the whole output would have had.

use core::fmt::{self, Write};

/// `sputchar()`'s state: the buffer and how far the output has gone (past the end, too).

                self.buf[self.pos] = latin1(c) as u8;
            }
            self.pos += 1;
        }
