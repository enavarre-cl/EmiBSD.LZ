/* <CODE> */
//! `stand.h`: the standalone library's interface: the file system and device switches, the
//! open file table entry, and what the program that links libsa must define.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/stand.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A boot program defines the tables libsa works through (`file_system[]`, `devsw[]`,
//! `constab[]` in its `conf.c`) and the machine-dependent routines it calls (`devopen()`,
//! `_rtt()`); the C resolves them when it links. Here the program gathers them in one
//! [`SaConf`] and hands it to [`sa_conf_register`] before it calls anything else in libsa.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `extern struct fs_ops file_system[]; extern int nfsys;`, `extern struct devsw devsw[];
//!   extern int ndevs;`, `extern struct consdev constab[]` (from `cons.c`), `devopen()`,
//!   `_rtt()` and `<machine/loadfile_machdep.h>`'s `LOADADDR` are the members of [`SaConf`]
//!   (slices carry their lengths: no `nfsys`/`ndevs`), as are the network code's
//!   `netif_drivers[]`/`n_netif_drivers` (`netif.h`) and `getsecs()` (`net.h`). Until a
//!   program registers its table libsa works on an empty one: no file systems, no devices,
//!   no console, no network interfaces, a clock stopped at 0.
//! - `struct fs_ops` and `struct devsw` hold Rust `fn` pointers; buffers are slices, the C's
//!   `size` is the slice's length, a NULL `resid`/`rsize` is `None`, and the routines return
//!   `Result<_, Errno>` where the C returns an error number or -1. `dv_open`'s variadic
//!   `char **file` is a `&mut &[u8]` the device may advance past its own prefix.
//!   `readdir`'s `char *name` (NULL to rewind) is `Option<&mut [u8]>`.
//! - `f_fsdata` is an owned `Box<dyn Any + Send>`: each file system keeps its own state type
//!   there and finds it again with a downcast, where the C casts a `void *` it `alloc()`ed.
//! - `struct stat` is libsa's subset ([`Stat`]); `max`/`min`, `bzero`/`bcmp`/`bcopy` and the
//!   string functions are Rust's own slice operations at the call sites; `btochs` has no
//!   caller in the boot programs ported here and is not declared.
//! - The prototypes of functions defined elsewhere in libsa live with their definitions.
