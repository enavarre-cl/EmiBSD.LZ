//! `lseek()`: move the offset of a file, or of a raw device.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/lseek.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Built with `__INTERNAL_LIBSA_CREAD`, as [`olseek`] (see `open.rs`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The new offset is an `Ok`, failure an `Err` (the C's -1), with `errno` set as in C.
