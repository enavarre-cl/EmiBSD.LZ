/* <CODE> */
//! The standalone dynamic memory allocator: a best-fit free list over a heap that only grows.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/alloc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Each block has `ALIGN(sizeof(unsigned)) + ALIGN(size)` bytes: the first word holds the
//! size of the user-data part; on the free list the block is a `struct fl` (size, then the
//! next free block). `free()` puts a block back on the list without merging; `alloc()` takes
//! an exact fit at once, otherwise the best fit unless that is twice the size or more, and
//! otherwise carves a new block from the top of the heap, panicking past `HEAP_LIMIT`.
//! Compiled as efiboot compiles it: best fit (no `ALLOC_FIRST_FIT`), with `NEEDS_HEAP_H`,
//! `NEEDS_HEAP_INIT` and `HEAP_LIMIT`, no `ALLOC_TRACE`, no `DEBUG`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The free list and `top` are a [`Heap`] value; the program's one is [`HEAP`], set up by
//!   [`heap_init`], which the program calls with its heap's start and `HEAP_LIMIT` (the C's
//!   `heap.h` hook reads both from globals). Tests run their own `Heap` on a buffer.
//! - Rust's allocations (`Box`, `Vec`: the file systems' buffers, zlib's state) come here
//!   too, through [`SaAlloc`], the `GlobalAlloc` the program installs; requests aligned to
//!   more than `ALIGN` (8 bytes) are padded and the block's start is kept in front of them.
