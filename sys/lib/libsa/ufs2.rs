//! Stand-alone file reading package for FFS2 (`struct ufs2_dinode`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/ufs2.c @ 3ce1f3f79392, sys/lib/libsa/ufs2.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `ufs2.c` is `ufs.c` with the FFS2 inode, 64-bit block addresses (`daddr_t`), the
//! super-block at `SBLOCK_UFS2` and `FS_UFS2_MAGIC`; here it is `ufs.rs`'s reader
//! ([`Ufs`]) instantiated for [`Ufs2Dinode`], with the `ufs2_*` entry points.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - As `ufs.rs`'s.
