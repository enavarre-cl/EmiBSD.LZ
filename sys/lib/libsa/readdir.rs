//! `opendir()`, `readdir()`, `closedir()`: the names in a directory, for boot(8)'s `ls`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/readdir.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Built with `__INTERNAL_LIBSA_CREAD`: the directory is opened, rewound and closed with
//! [`oopen`], [`olseek`] and [`oclose`].
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Failure is an `Err` (the C's -1), with `errno` set as in C; the end of the directory is
//!   the file system's own error (`ufs_readdir` returns -1).
