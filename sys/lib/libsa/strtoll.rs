/* <CODE> */
//! `strtoll()`: a string to a `long long`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/strtoll.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Ignores `locale' stuff. Assumes that the upper and lower case alphabets and digits are
//! each contiguous. Unlike libsa's `strtol`, it skips only `isspace` (a blank or a tab) in
//! front of the number; it saturates at `LLONG_MIN`/`LLONG_MAX` on overflow.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The string is a byte slice, its end standing for the NUL; `endptr` is the index
//!   returned beside the value. The conversion loop is `strtol.rs`'s (`long` and `long long`
//!   are both 64-bit on amd64 and arm64).

use crate::stand::isspace;
use crate::strtol::strtonum;

/// `strtoll(nptr, &endptr, base)`: the value and the index where the number ended (0 if
/// there was none).
pub fn strtoll(nptr: &[u8], base: i32) -> (i64, usize) {
    strtonum(nptr, base, isspace)
}
