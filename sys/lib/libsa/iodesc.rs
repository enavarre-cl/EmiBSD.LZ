//! `iodesc.h`: the I/O descriptor of a network socket of the standalone network code: the
//! two ends' addresses and ports, the transaction id and the interface it uses.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/lib/libsa/iodesc.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct netif *io_netif` is the interface itself, `Option<Netif>` (`None` for the C's
//!   NULL, a free socket): `netif_select` returns the chosen interface by value where the C
//!   returns its `static struct netif best_if`, which every open socket would then share.
