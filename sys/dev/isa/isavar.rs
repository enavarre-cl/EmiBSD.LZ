/* <CODE> */
//! The ISA bus's shared definitions: `<dev/isa/isavar.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/isavar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `NISADMA` is 0: `isadma0 at isa?` is in GENERIC, but `isadma.c` is not ported, so the
//!   `#if NISADMA > 0` members (`iba_dmat`, `ia_dmat`, the DMA state of `struct isa_softc`)
//!   and the `ISA_DRQ_*` macros over them are left out, as for a kernel without it.
//!   `NISAPNP` is 0 too (ISA PnP is not in amd64's GENERIC): `struct isapnp_softc`, the
//!   `ISAPNP_*` register macros and the `isapnp_*` prototypes are for `isapnp.c`, which is
//!   not ported; the PnP members of `struct isa_attach_args` are kept, since the compatibility
//!   names (`ia_iobase`, `ia_irq`, ...) live in them.
//! - The `ia_*` compatibility macros (`#define ia_iobase ipa_io[0].base`) are accessor
//!   methods ([`IsaAttachArgs::ia_iobase`], [`IsaAttachArgs::set_ia_iobase`], ...), and the
//!   `cf_*` locator macros (`#define cf_iobase cf_loc[0]`) are functions of a `Cfdata`.
//! - `struct isapnp_pin`'s `flags:4, type:4` bit-fields are one byte (`flags_type`), the
//!   flags in the low nibble.
//! - The `isa_softc`'s `sc_subdevs` list and `struct isadev` are kept; nothing links an
//!   `isadev` yet (only `isapnp.c` does).
