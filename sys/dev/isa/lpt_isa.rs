//! `lpt(4)` on the ISA bus: `dev/isa/lpt_isa.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/lpt_isa.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The probe's logic:
//!
//! 1. You should be able to write to and read back the same value to the data port. Do an
//!    alternating zeros, alternating ones, walking zero, and walking one test to check for
//!    stuck bits.
//! 2. You should be able to write to and read back the same value to the control port lower
//!    5 bits, the upper 3 bits are reserved per the IBM PC technical reference manuals and
//!    different boards do different things with them. Do an alternating zeros, alternating
//!    ones, walking zero, and walking one test to check for stuck bits. Some printers drag
//!    the strobe line down when the are powered off so this bit has been masked out of the
//!    control port test. (XXX Some printers may not like a fast pulse on init or strobe, I
//!    don't know at this point, if that becomes a problem these bits should be turned off in
//!    the mask byte for the control port test.)
//! 3. Set the data and control ports to a value of 0.
//!
//! (The C tests the data port only, as here.)
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `DEBUG`'s `ABORT` message is not carried over (`DEBUG` is not configured).
//! - `__NO_ISA_INTR_CHECK` is not defined on amd64, so the probe checks the IRQ with
//!   `isa_intr_check` through the parent `isa_softc`'s chipset tag, as the C does.
