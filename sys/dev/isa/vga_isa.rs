//! `vga(4)` at `isa`: the VGA at its fixed ISA addresses (I/O 0x3b0-0x3df, memory
//! 0xa0000-0xbffff), driven by `vga.c`; and `<dev/isa/vga_isavar.h>`, whose one prototype
//! is [`vga_isa_cnattach`].
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/vga_isa.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/vga_isavar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! On a PC whose VGA is a PCI function, OpenBSD finds it at `pci` first, and the ISA probe
//! fails because the VGA's I/O ports are then claimed in the `ioport_ex` extent. On QEMU's
//! q35 under UEFI (the `just smoke` machine) the probe fails earlier: the legacy text
//! memory does not answer, so neither `vga1 at pci0` nor `vga0 at isa0` attaches, as an
//! OpenBSD 8.0 snapshot shows on that machine.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Without the `ioport_ex` extent (`subr_extent.c`, not ported; see
//!   `arch/amd64/amd64/bus_space.rs`) a map does not fail on ports another device holds:
//!   on a machine where a PCI VGA does attach (a BIOS boot, not how EmiBSD boots), this
//!   probe would succeed too and attach a second `vga`, where OpenBSD's fails.
//! - The `#if 0` softc member `sc_vc` is not here, as in C.
