/* <CODE> */
//! The goo that binds the floppy controller to its devices: `<dev/isa/fdlink.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/fdlink.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! fdc(4)'s softc, its controller states, the drive queue its fd(4) children share, and the
//! attach arguments `fdcattach` hands each drive. The functions it declares are `fdc.c`'s
//! (`fdcresult`, `out_fdc`, `fdcstart`, `fdcstatus`, `fdcpseudointr`) and `fd.c`'s
//! (`fd_nvtotype`). Like them, it exists where cfg `machine_x86` is set: `struct fd_type`
//! is `<machine/ioctl_fd.h>`'s, an x86 header (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `machine_x86`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `enum fdc_state` and `enum fdc_type` are `i32` constants: `fdtimeout` steps the state
//!   with `sc_state++`.
//! - `sc_link`'s union of `struct fdc_fdlink` and `struct fdc_ftlink` is the disk link
//!   alone: `struct ft_softc` (the QIC-117 tape driver) exists in no file of the tree, and
//!   nothing reads `ftlink`.
//! - The softc's members are `Cell`s: fdc.c and fd.c change them at `splbio` from the
//!   strategy routine, the interrupt handler and the timeouts, as the C does. `sc_fd[]`
//!   holds `&'static FdSoftc`s (softcs live as long as the kernel).
