/* <CODE> */
//! The ISA DMA interface: `<dev/isa/isadmavar.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/isadmavar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The functions it declares (`isa_dmacascade`, `isa_dmamap_create`, `isa_dmastart`, ...)
//! are `isadma.c`'s, in `isadma.rs`. `__ISADMA_COMPAT` is always defined ("XXX for now..."),
//! so the old interface fd(4) still uses is here: the `isadma_*` macros, which call those
//! functions on the bus `isadmaattach` recorded (`isa_dev`) with the channel's preallocated
//! map (`BUS_DMA_BUS1` marks the call as such).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `isadma_*` compatibility macros are functions. `isadma_acquire` and `isadma_release` are not ported: they expand to
//!   `isa_dma_acquire`/`isa_dma_release`, which no file of the tree defines (no caller
//!   either), so the C compiles them only because nobody uses them.
//! - `isadma_start` takes the buffer as `*mut u8` (`caddr_t`), its length as `BusSize`.
