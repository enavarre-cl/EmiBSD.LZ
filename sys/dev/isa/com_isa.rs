//! `com(4)` on the ISA bus: `dev/isa/com_isa.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/isa/com_isa.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The softc reaches `com_attach_subr` as `&'static`: `config_make_softc`'s allocation is
//!   never freed while the device is attached, and the interrupt is established under the
//!   device's name ([`Device::xname`]).
