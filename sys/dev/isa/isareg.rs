//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 needs the timer and RTC ports for `delay(9)`; M7b the ISA
//! memory hole (`bus_space_map`); the ISA bus (M8) adds the DMA controllers' ports
//! (`isaattach` maps the delay port among the page registers); `pckbc(4)` (M16d) the
//! keyboard controller's `IO_KBD`. The other port assignments
//! and the IRQ names come with their drivers.
