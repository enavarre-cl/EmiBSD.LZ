//! ipmi(4) on the device tree: `dev/fdt/ipmi_fdt.c`. An `ipmi-kcs` node is a KCS interface
//! (IPMI 2.0) in memory space at its first `reg`, with optional `reg-size` (the register
//! width) and `reg-spacing` properties; the rest is `ipmi_attach_common`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/fdt/ipmi_fdt.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! arm64's GENERIC has `ipmi* at fdt?`; QEMU's `virt` has no `ipmi-kcs` node, so it attaches
//! nowhere in the smokes.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The attach arguments are the machine's `struct fdt_attach_args`
//!   (`machine::fdt::FdtAttachArgs`).
