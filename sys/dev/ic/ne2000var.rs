//! NE2000-compatible softc (`dev/ic/ne2000var.h`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/ne2000var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct ne2000_softc` is `#[repr(C)]` with the [`Dp8390Softc`] first (so the C's casts
//!   between the two are [`ne2000_softc`] in `ne2000.rs`), its bus space tag and handle are
//!   `Option`s in `Cell`s, and the anonymous `enum` of `sc_type` is [`Ne2000Type`], whose
//!   `NE2000_TYPE_UNKNOWN` (0) is the all-zero value of a fresh softc.
//! - The prototypes are `ne2000.rs`'s functions.
