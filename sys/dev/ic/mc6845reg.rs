//! `<dev/ic/mc6845reg.h>`: the registers of the Motorola 6845 CRT controller, as the PC
//! display adapters (MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA) carry it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/mc6845reg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The registers are reached through an index and a data port; `struct reg_mc6845` only
//! gives each register its index, as the offset of a byte field, which the
//! `pcdisplay_6845_read`/`pcdisplay_6845_write` macros take with `offsetof`. Here it is the
//! `#[repr(C)]` [`RegMc6845`], whose field offsets ([`core::mem::offset_of!`]) are the
//! indices; its size is what `vga_pci.c` saves and restores.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The C's fields are `char`; here they are `u8`, the register width.

/// `struct reg_mc6845`: indexed via port 0x3d4 (mono 0x3b4).
