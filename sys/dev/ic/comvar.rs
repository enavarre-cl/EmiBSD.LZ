/* <CODE> */
//! The `com(4)` driver's private header: `<dev/ic/comvar.h>`, what `com.c` shares with its bus
//! front-ends (`com_isa`, `com_pci`, `com_acpi`, `com_fdt`, `commulti`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/comvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The prototypes it declares are the functions of `com.rs`, and the `comcons*` externs are
//! the globals `com.rs` defines.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - [`ComSoftc`] is a softc (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`): `#[repr(C)]`, the device first, every
//!   member a `Cell` (the driver, its interrupt handlers and the tty layer change them through
//!   `struct com_softc *`), all-zero valid for `config_make_softc`'s `M_ZERO`. The bus tag
//!   and handle are `Option`s (unset before the attachment fills them); `sc_ih`, `sc_si` and
//!   `sc_tty` are pointers in `Cell`s.
//! - The input ring's four pointers (`sc_ibuf`, `sc_ibufp`, `sc_ibufhigh`, `sc_ibufend`) are
//!   the index of the buffer being filled in `sc_ibufs` and its fill count
//!   ([`ComSoftc::sc_ibuf`], [`ComSoftc::sc_ibufp`]); the high-water mark and the end are the
//!   constants `COM_IHIGHWATER` and `COM_IBUFSIZE`. The buffers are `Cell<u8>`s, written by
//!   `comintr` and read by `comsoft`.
//! - The power-management hooks return `Result` where `enable` returns an `int` errno.
//! - `ca_noien` is a `bool`; `ca_iobase` is a `BusAddr` (an `int` in C).
