//! Register definitions for the Intel 8253 Programmable Interval Timer: `<dev/ic/i8253reg.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/i8253reg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! This chip has three independent 16-bit down counters that can be read on the fly. There are
//! three mode registers and three countdown registers. The countdown registers are addressed
//! directly, via the first three I/O ports. The three mode registers are accessed via the fourth
//! I/O port, with two bits in the mode byte indicating the register.
//!
//! To read the current value ("on the fly") from the countdown register, write a "latch"
//! command into the mode register, then read the stable value from the corresponding I/O port.
//! Reading in this manner has no side effects.
//!
//! The outputs of the three timers are connected as follows: timer 0 to irq 0 (`hardclock`),
//! timer 1 to dma channel 0 (dram refresh), timer 2 to the speaker (console beeps).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `TIMER_DIV(x)` is the `const fn` [`timer_div`].

/// Frequency of all three count-down timers; `TIMER_FREQ / freq` is the appropriate count to
/// generate a frequency of `freq` Hz.
pub const TIMER_FREQ: i32 = 1_193_182;

    (TIMER_FREQ + x / 2) / x
