/* <CODE> */
//! re(4): the Realtek 8139C+/8169/8169S/8110S/8168/8101 driver, bus-independent part
//! (`dev/ic/re.c`, with the prototypes of `<dev/ic/revar.h>`). `if_re_pci.rs` attaches it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/re.c @ 3ce1f3f79392, sys/dev/ic/revar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The driver uses the C+ descriptor rings of these chips: one transmit and one receive ring
//! of `struct rl_desc` in `bus_dma(9)` memory, checksum offload, simulated (timer based)
//! interrupt moderation, the EEPROM or the ID registers for the station address, and the
//! mii(4) layer for the PHY (on the 8139C+ the PHY registers are MAC registers that
//! `re_miibus_readreg` maps; the gigabit chips go through `RL_PHYAR`). QEMU's `rtl8139` is
//! an 8139C+ (`RL_HWREV_8139CPLUS`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Locking as in C, made explicit: `re_start` runs on whatever CPU serves the send queue,
//!   `re_intr` is established `IPL_MPSAFE` (it takes the kernel lock only around `re_init`),
//!   the ioctls, the tick and `re_init`/`re_stop` run under the kernel lock. `rl_flags` and
//!   the transmit producer/consumer indices are atomics (`rtl81x9reg.rs`); each
//!   transmit slot belongs to `re_start` or `re_txeof` by those indices, as in C; the receive
//!   ring is the interrupt's, and `re_init`/`re_stop`'s with the interrupt barred.
//! - The descriptor rings are DMA memory reached through raw pointers with bounds-checked
//!   accessors; every access reads or writes a whole descriptor, volatile (`|=` on a
//!   descriptor is a read, a change and a write).
//! - `kstat(4)` is not configured (`NKSTAT` 0): `re_kstat_attach`, `re_kstat_detach`,
//!   `re_kstat_read`, `re_kstat_copy`, `struct re_kstats`, `re_kstats_tpl`,
//!   `struct re_kstat_softc` and the `RE_DTCCR_*` registers are compiled out, as in such a C
//!   kernel; comments mark the call sites.
//! - `vlan(4)` is not configured: the `#if NVLAN > 0` blocks are behind the constant
//!   [`NVLAN`] (0), so `IFCAP_VLAN_HWTAGGING` is not offered and tags are neither inserted
//!   nor taken from the descriptors. `SMALL_KERNEL` is not defined (`re_wol` is here).
//! - `RE_DEBUG` is not defined: `redebug` and `DPRINTF` are left out.
//! - `re_encap`'s software checksum for oversized frames on `RL_FLAG_JUMBOV2` chips builds no
//!   stack mbuf: `re_jumbo_cksum` sums the IP header and the payload at their offsets in the
//!   chain (`in4_cksum`) and writes them back with `m_copyback`, what `in_cksum` and
//!   `in_delayed_cksum` do on the C's `mh`.
//! - `re_read_eeprom` fills a `&mut [u16]` (the C's `caddr_t` of words);
//!   `re_eeprom_getword` returns the word.
//! - `re_init`'s ID register writes read the address through an 8-byte zeroed copy (the
//!   C's union reads two bytes past the address).
//! - `re_init` acknowledges `rl_intrs` in `RL_ISR` before `re_setup_intr`, where the C does
//!   it after. `re_setup_intr` starts the simulated moderation timer (`RL_TIMERINT` 0x400,
//!   about 31 us at 33 MHz), whose one expiry is the only interrupt `RL_INTRS_TIMER`
//!   enables; when it expires before the C's acknowledgement (QEMU's 8139C+ runs it in
//!   virtual time, and on arm64 one boot in three did), the acknowledgement clears it, no
//!   interrupt comes and transmissions wait for the watchdog. Acknowledging first keeps the
//!   C's intent (no stale status) without the race. It is harmless: a status bit pending
//!   from before `re_init` carries no work, since `re_init` has just stopped the chip and
//!   rebuilt both rings, and a bit set between the acknowledgement and `re_setup_intr` is
//!   new work that now raises its interrupt where the C would have cleared it. The loss is
//!   the device's, not the kernel's interrupt path: re(4) is on INTx (level) on both archs,
//!   established at attach long before `re_init`, which runs at `splnet`; clearing the bit
//!   deasserts the line, so no interrupt is left for any controller to deliver.
//! - `re_newbuf` unloads the cluster's map before freeing it when the descriptor is still
//!   the chip's (the C frees the mbuf and leaves the map loaded).
//! - The revision switch of `re_attach`, with its fall-throughs, is `re_hwrev_flags`, which
//!   returns the flags and the maximum MTU of a chip.
//! - Functions returning 0 or an errno return `Result<(), Errno>`; `re_attach` too (the C's
//!   1 is an `Err`); `re_rxeof`/`re_txeof` return `bool`, `re_encap` the slots it used.
//! - `re_intr`, `re_tick` and `re_txstart` take the softc as the C's `void *`.
