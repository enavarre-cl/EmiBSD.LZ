/* <CODE> */
//! `<dev/ic/am79900reg.h>`: the 32-bit software model (ILACC, PCnet-PCI) of the AMD LANCE
//! family: the receive and transmit message descriptors, the initialization block and their
//! bits. pcn(4) uses it with software styles 2 and 3 (`LE_B20_SSTYLE_PCNETPCI2/3` in
//! `lancereg.rs`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/am79900reg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The descriptors and the initialization block are `#[repr(C)]` structs of plain `u32`
//!   words (the `int32_t` members, `rmd3`, `tmd3` and `pad`, are `u32` too: nothing reads
//!   them), 16 bytes for a descriptor and 32 for the block, as in C. A const assertion checks
//!   the sizes. `init_ladrf` is the four `u16` of the logical address filter; the offsets in
//!   the C comments are the C's.
//! - Constants are `u32`. `LE_T3_BITS` keeps the C name; its string has the octal escapes
//!   written as `\xNN`. The `#if 0` `LE_T3_TDR_MASK` is not ported.
