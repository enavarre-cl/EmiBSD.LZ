//! Definitions for the Motorola MC146818A Real Time Clock: `<dev/ic/mc146818reg.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/mc146818reg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! They also apply for the (compatible) Dallas Semiconductor DS1287A RTC. The MC146818A has 16
//! registers. The first 10 contain time-of-year and alarm data. The rest contain various
//! control and status bits.
//!
//! To read or write the registers, one writes the register number to the RTC's control port,
//! then either reads from or writes the new data to the RTC's data port. Since the locations
//! of these ports and the method used to access them can be machine-dependent, the low-level
//! details of reading and writing the RTC's registers are handled by machine-specific
//! functions (`mc146818_read` and `mc146818_write`; amd64's are in `isa/clock.rs`).
//!
//! The time-of-year and alarm data can be expressed in either binary or BCD, and they are
//! selected by a bit in register B. The "hour" fields can either be expressed in AM/PM format
//! or in 24-hour format, again selected by a bit in register B. It is assumed that if systems
//! are going to use BCD (rather than binary) mode, or AM/PM hour format, they will do the
//! appropriate conversions in machine-dependent code. Also, if the clock is switched between
//! BCD and binary mode, or between AM/PM mode and 24-hour mode, the time-of-day and alarm
//! registers are NOT automatically reset; they must be reprogrammed with correct values.
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `mc146818_read`/`mc146818_write` are not declared here: Rust has no prototypes, and the
//!   machine-dependent definitions are what [`mc146818_gettod`] and [`mc146818_puttod`] are
//!   handed, as closures (the `sc` argument of the C macros is whatever the closures capture).
//! - `MC146818_GETTOD(sc, regs)` and `MC146818_PUTTOD(sc, regs)` are those two functions.
//! - The constants with a lower-case unit in their C name are upper case (`MC_RATE_1024_Hz` is
//!   `MC_RATE_1024_HZ`, `MC_BASE_32_KHz` is `MC_BASE_32_KHZ`, `MC_BASE_4_MHz` is
//!   `MC_BASE_4_MHZ`), as Rust's naming lint wants.
//! - `mc_todregs` is [`McTodregs`], an array of `u32` (`u_int`).
