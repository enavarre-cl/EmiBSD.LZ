/* <CODE> */
//! The VGA's character generator and screen geometry: loading a font into one of the eight
//! font slots of plane 2 (`vga_loadchars`), choosing the slots the two halves of a
//! 512-character set come from (`vga_setfontset`), and programming the 6845 and the
//! attribute controller for a screen type (`vga_setscreentype`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/vga_subr.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The font memory is only reachable after the sequencer and the graphics controller are
//! switched from odd/even text addressing to plain access of plane 2 at 0xa0000
//! (`fontram`); `textram` switches them back.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `vga_loadchars` takes the font as a byte slice of `num * lpc` glyph rows (the C's
//!   `char *`); a shorter slice loads only the glyphs it holds.
//! - `PCDISPLAY_SOFTCURSOR` is `pcdisplay_subr.rs`'s constant: not set, so
//!   `vga_setscreentype` programs the hardware cursor's scan lines, as the C without the
//!   option does.
