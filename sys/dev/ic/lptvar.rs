//! `<dev/ic/lptvar.h>`: lpt(4)'s softc, shared by its bus front ends (`lpt_isa.c`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ic/lptvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The functions this header declares (`lptintr`, `lpt_port_test`, `lpt_attach_common`,
//! `lpt_activate`) live in `dev/ic/lpt.rs`, where the C defines them.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members the C changes through a shared softc are `Cell`s (the softc is reached
//!   from the interrupt, the timeout and the system calls under `spltty` and the kernel
//!   lock, as in the C); the bus tag and handle are `Option`s, set by the front end's
//!   attach.
