/* <CODE> */
//! wd(4)'s softc and the request it hands its controller: `struct ata_bio`, the parameters a
//! controller needs to perform one ATA block transfer, and the drive states the transfer
//! code walks through before the drive is ready.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ata/wdvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `wdc_ata_bio` is in `ata_wdc.rs`, `wddone` in `wd.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members changed after attach are `Cell`s: the softc and its `ata_bio` are shared by
//!   reference between the block device entry points, the channel's interrupt handler and the
//!   restart timeout, under `splbio`, as the C shares them by pointer. `sc_params` is an
//!   `UnsafeCell` read in place ([`WdSoftc::params`]) and written through
//!   [`WdSoftc::params_mut`].
//! - `ata_bio`'s `lp` points at the disk's in-core label, read in place by the transfer code
//!   ([`AtaBio::label`]); `databuf` stays a raw pointer to the buffer's `bcount` bytes; `wd`
//!   points back at the softc.
//! - `wd_hibernate_io` is declared for `option HIBERNATE`, which is not configured: it is not
//!   compiled (`ata_wdc.rs`).
