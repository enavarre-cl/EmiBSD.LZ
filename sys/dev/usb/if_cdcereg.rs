//! `<dev/usb/if_cdcereg.h>`: the cdce(4) softc, its transfer chains and the table entry type.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/usb/if_cdcereg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The softc's members the stack changes after attach are `Cell`s (the kernel lock at
//!   `splnet()`/`splusb()`, as in C); the USB handles (`cdce_udev`, `cdce_ctl_iface`,
//!   `cdce_data_iface`, the pipes, the xfers) are `Cell<Option<&'static T>>`
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, `usbd_device *`), `cdce_buf` the xfer's DMA buffer as a raw
//!   pointer, `cdce_mbuf` an `Option<&'static Mbuf>`, `cdce_sc` the softc as a raw pointer
//!   (the chain lives inside it).
//! - `GET_IFP(sc)` is [`CdceSoftc::get_ifp`]. The all-zero softc is valid (`config_make_softc`
//!   zeroes it): the C's `cdce_attached` and `cdce_flags` start at 0 as well.
