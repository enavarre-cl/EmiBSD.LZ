//! `<dev/clock_subr.h>`: the time-of-day clock chip interface.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/clock_subr.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. `struct todr_chip_handle` and the `todr_gettime`/`todr_settime`/
//! `todr_wenable` macros; `todr_attach` is `kern_time.c`'s. No driver attaches a chip yet
//! (the mc146818 on amd64, the PL031 on arm64 are not ported).
