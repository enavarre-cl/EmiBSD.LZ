//! `com(4)` on `puc(4)`: `dev/puc/com_puc.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/puc/com_puc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A serial port of a PCI multi-port card: takes the interrupt `puc*` mapped, the registers it
//! sub-regioned for the port, and the clock of the card's UART (`puc_port_types`), then attaches
//! the generic `com(4)` driver.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `intr_string` never fails here (`pci_intr_string` returns a string by value), so the C's
//!   `if (intrstr != NULL)` tests are gone.
//! - The softc reaches `com_attach_subr` as `&'static` and the interrupt is established under
//!   the device's name, as in `com_isa.rs`.
//! - `com_puc_detach` is `com_detach` as in the C; the interrupt is disestablished by the card
//!   (`puc_pci_detach`).
