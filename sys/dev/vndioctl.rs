/* <CODE> */
//! `<dev/vndioctl.h>`: the ioctls of vnd(4), the vnode disk: configure a unit over a file
//! (`VNDIOCSET`), unconfigure it (`VNDIOCCLR`) and ask what a unit covers (`VNDIOCGET`), as
//! vnconfig(8) and mount_vnd(8) issue them on `/dev/rvndNc`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/vndioctl.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The structures are `#[repr(C)]` ABI types with LP64 sizes and offsets checked at
//!   compile time. `struct vnd_ioctl`'s two bytes of tail padding after `vnd_type` are the
//!   named `_pad0`, so that every byte is a field and the structure can be read and written
//!   as plain bytes ([`AbiPod`]).
//! - `char *vnd_file` and `u_char *vnd_key` are `usize`s: user addresses, only handed to
//!   `copyinstr`/`copyin` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`). `size_t` is `usize`, `off_t` [`Off`],
//!   `dev_t` [`Dev`], `ino_t` [`Ino`].
