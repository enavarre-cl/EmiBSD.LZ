//! `dev/acpi/acpiutil.c`: the checksum of the firmware tables.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/acpi/acpiutil.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The table is a byte slice (the C's pointer and length). `ACPI_DEBUG` is not
//!   configured, so the "bad checksum" trace is compiled out, as in C.

/// `acpi_checksum(v, len)`: the sum of the table's bytes, modulo 256; 0 for a valid table.
