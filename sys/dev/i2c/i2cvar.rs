//! `<dev/i2c/i2cvar.h>`: the interface between the i2c framework and an i2c controller, and
//! the attach arguments of the bus and of its devices.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/i2c/i2cvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A controller fills in an [`I2cController`] (the `i2c_controller` its `i2c_tag_t` points
//! to): an `ic_exec` function for the scripted API, or the low-level `ic_send_start`, ...,
//! `ic_write_byte` ones, with `ic_acquire_bus`/`ic_release_bus` serialising its users. It
//! attaches the bus with an [`I2cbusAttachArgs`] (`config_found(self, &iba, iicbus_print)`),
//! and the `iic` driver (`i2c.rs`) attaches its devices with an [`I2cAttachArgs`] each.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `i2c_tag_t` (a pointer) is [`I2cTag`], a `&'static I2cController`: the controller lives
//!   in its driver's softc, which is never freed while the device exists. The members the
//!   controller sets in its attach are `Cell`s (the softc is made zero-filled).
//! - The function pointers keep their C order and meaning, with slices for the
//!   `(pointer, length)` pairs of `ic_exec` (`cmd`, `buf`) and `&mut u8` for `ic_read_byte`'s
//!   byte. They return the C `int` (0 for success, nonzero for failure), not an `Errno`: the
//!   controllers return a bare 1 and the clients only compare with 0.
//! - A hook a controller left unset is `None` where the C would call through a NULL pointer:
//!   [`iic_acquire_bus`] and [`iic_release_bus`] then do nothing (a bus without locking), the
//!   other hooks fail with `ENXIO`.
//! - `ia_name` is a byte slice instead of a `char *`: the name, or (when `ia_namelen` is not 0)
//!   the concatenation of NUL-terminated names of `ia_namelen` bytes.
//! - `iba_bus_scan` takes the bus attach arguments as a reference instead of the C's `void *`.
//! - The `_I2C_PRIVATE` macros (`iic_send_start`, ..., `iic_write_byte`) are
//!   functions; `iic_scan` and `iic_print` are declared by `i2c_scan.rs` and `i2c.rs`.
