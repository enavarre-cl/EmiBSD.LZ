//! `iic*`: the i2c bus (`iic* at piixpm?`, `iic* at ichiic?`), see `iic(4)`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/i2c/i2c.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A controller driver attaches the bus with an [`I2cbusAttachArgs`]; `iic` attaches the
//! devices the kernel configuration names (`iic_search`: the entries with an `addr` locator)
//! and then scans the bus for known device signatures (`iic_scan` in `i2c_scan.rs`, or the
//! controller's own `iba_bus_scan`). A device found that no driver claims prints
//! `"name" at iic0 addr 0x50 not configured`, through [`iic_print`].
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `iic_search` reads `cf_loc[IICCF_ADDR]` as a `get`: an entry without locators is skipped
//!   (the C would read past its `loc[]`). No entry of this kernel's tables is a child of
//!   `iic` yet (`spdmem`, `lm`, ... are not ported), so the search finds none.
//! - `iic_is_compatible` returns a `bool` and takes `name` as a `&str`.
