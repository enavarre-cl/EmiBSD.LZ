//! `<dev/i2c/i2c_io.h>`: the I2C operations and addresses a client of the i2c framework names.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/i2c/i2c_io.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `i2c_op_t` is the newtype [`I2cOp`] over the C enum's `int`, with the constants
//!   `I2C_OP_READ`, ... as `const`s of that type; the `I2C_OP_STOP_P`, `I2C_OP_WRITE_P`,
//!   `I2C_OP_READ_P` and `I2C_OP_BLKMODE_P` macros are its methods `stop_p`, `write_p`,
//!   `read_p` and `blkmode_p`.
//! - The `#ifdef notyet` part (`i2c_ioctl_exec_t`, `I2C_IOCTL_EXEC`) is not configured: nothing
//!   in the tree defines `notyet`, and no `/dev/iic` exists to take the ioctl.
