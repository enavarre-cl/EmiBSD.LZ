//! `dev/mulaw.c` and `<dev/mulaw.h>`: conversions between ITU G.711 mu-law and signed
//! linear samples, for audio(4)'s encoding emulation.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/mulaw.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/dev/mulaw.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The two tables (`mulawtolin16`, `lintomulaw`) are computed at compile time from the
//!   G.711 definition (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, constant tables): [`mulaw_decode`] and
//!   [`linear_to_mulaw`]. `just test-ref` compares all 768 bytes with the C tables.
//! - The `(u_char *p, int cc)` pairs are byte slices. The 24-bit conversions work on the
//!   slice's 4-byte groups in native byte order, as the C's `int *` walk does, without
//!   requiring the slice to be `int`-aligned; a trailing partial group is left alone, as
//!   the C's `(cc -= 4) >= 0` loop leaves it.
