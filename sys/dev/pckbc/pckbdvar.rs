//! The console and bell hooks of `pckbd(4)`: `<dev/pckbc/pckbdvar.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pckbc/pckbdvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The header declares two functions of `pckbd.c`: `pckbd_cnattach`, which `pckbc(4)`'s
//! console attach calls, and `pckbd_hookup_bell`, which a beeper (`pcppi(4)`) calls to ring
//! the keyboard's bell.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The prototypes are re-exports of the functions in `pckbd.rs`.
