//! `<dev/midi_if.h>`: the interface between midi(4) and the hardware drivers.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/midi_if.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A hardware driver (eap(4)'s UART) fills a `static` [`MidiHwIf`] and hands it, with its
//! own softc as the opaque handle, to `midi_attach_mi` (`dev/midi.rs`, where the C defines
//! it); midi(4) then calls the driver through the table with that handle first.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The operations are `unsafe fn`s over the `void *` handle, as `audio_if.h`'s are
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, a table of function pointers over an opaque `void *`); every
//!   member is an `Option`, NULL in C.
//! - `struct midi_info`'s `name` is a `&'static str`: the drivers hand out string
//!   literals.
