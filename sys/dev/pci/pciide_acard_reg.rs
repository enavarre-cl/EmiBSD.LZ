//! Acard ATP850U/ATP860/ATP865 IDE controller registers.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pci/pciide_acard_reg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The function-like macros are `const fn`s named in lower case. The configuration-space
//!   offsets `pciide.c` reads and writes are `i32` (`pci_conf_read`'s `reg`), bus space
//!   offsets `BusSize`, shift counts `i32`, register values and unused offsets `u32`.
//! - The `static` timing tables are `pub const` arrays named in capitals, of `u8` where the
//!   C has `int8_t` or `u_int8_t` (every entry is written to a byte-wide register or shifted
//!   into a field, never sign-extended).
