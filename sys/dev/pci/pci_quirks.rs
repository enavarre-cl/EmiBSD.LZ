//! PCI quirk data table and lookup function: `dev/pci/pci_quirks.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pci/pci_quirks.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Devices whose header type lies about having several functions: `pci_enumerate_bus`
//! probes eight functions of a `PCI_QUIRK_MULTIFUNCTION` device and one of a
//! `PCI_QUIRK_MONOFUNCTION` one.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pci_lookup_quirkdata` returns an `Option` (`None` for the C's NULL).
