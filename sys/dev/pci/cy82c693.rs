/* <CODE> */
//! Common routines to read/write control registers on the Cypress 82c693 hyperCache(tm)
//! Stand-Alone PCI Peripheral Controller with USB (`pciide.c`'s cy693 path).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pci/cy82c693.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `cyhc_handle` and `cyhc_initialized` are one `StaticCell<Option<Cy82c693Handle>>`:
//!   `Some` is "initialized". Like the C, it is written once, at autoconf time, by the
//!   first `cy82c693_init`, and only read afterwards.
//! - `cy82c693_init`'s `panic("cy82c693_init")` when called again with another tag is not
//!   made: the machine's bus space tags have no equality (`BusSpace::Tag` is only `Copy`).
//!   Its one caller, `cy693_chip_map`, always passes its PCI bus's I/O tag.
