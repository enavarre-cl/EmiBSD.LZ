//! The softc of gcu(4), the EP80579 (Tolapai) Global Configuration Unit
//! (`<dev/pci/gcu_var.h>`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pci/gcu_var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The whole header. em(4)'s `struct em_hw` points at it (`hw->gcu`) and `if_em_soc.c`
//! drives the GCU's MDIO registers under `mdio_mtx`. gcu(4) itself (`gcu.c`) is configured
//! only by i386 GENERIC and is not ported, so no `GcuSoftc` exists on amd64 or arm64.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `#[repr(C)]` with the device first, as every softc here; `addr` and `size` are the
//!   mapped window, `tag` and `handle` the mapping.
