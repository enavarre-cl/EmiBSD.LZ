//! em(4) on the EP80579 (Tolapai) SoC (`<dev/pci/if_em_soc.h>` and `if_em_soc.c`): finding
//! the GCU (the unit that owns the MDIO bus of the SoC's MACs) and the PHY register access
//! through it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pci/if_em_soc.h @ 3ce1f3f79392, sys/dev/pci/if_em_soc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The header's prototypes and constants and the file's functions share this module. gcu(4)
//! is configured only by i386 GENERIC: on amd64 and arm64 `NGCU` is 0, so
//! [`em_lookup_gcu`] finds none, `hw.gcu` stays `None`, and the MDIO functions return at
//! once, as the C does with a NULL `hw->gcu`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `em_lookup_gcu` returns `Option<NonNull<GcuSoftc>>` (the C's `void *`); it is the
//!   `NGCU == 0` branch, the only one this kernel configures.
//! - `DEVNAME(sc)` (the em softc's name, reached through `osdep->dev`) is the name of
//!   `osdep.dev`, the same device; `"em"` when the device is not set.
//! - The command-and-poll sequence both MDIO functions write out is `gcu_mdio_command`.
//! - The `struct device *self` arguments of `em_lookup_gcu` and `em_attach_miibus` are
//!   `&Device`; neither function reads it.
