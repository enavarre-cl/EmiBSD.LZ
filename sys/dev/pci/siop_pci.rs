//! `siop* at pci?`: the PCI front-end of siop(4) ("SYM53c8xx PCI-SCSI I/O Processors
//! driver: PCI front-end"): matches the Symbios chips `siop_pci_common` knows and attaches
//! the adapter.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/pci/siop_pci.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct siop_pci_softc` is `#[repr(C)]`, the siop softc first (itself headed by the
//!   device), as in the C; `siop.rs` relies on that order.
//! - The softc is reached as `&'static` (softcs are never freed while the device exists).
