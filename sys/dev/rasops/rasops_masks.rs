//! Bit masks for the sub-byte depths: `dev/rasops/rasops_masks.c` and `rasops_masks.h`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/rasops/rasops_masks.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/dev/rasops/rasops_masks.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The `ragged edge` masks ([`RASOPS_LMASK`], [`RASOPS_RMASK`]), the part masks
//! ([`RASOPS_PMASK`]) and the `MBL`/`MBR`/`MBE`/`GETBITS`/`PUTBITS` macros that `rasops1`
//! and `rasops4` (through `rasops_bitops`) use to move runs of 1-bit and 4-bit pixels in
//! 32-bit words.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The C writes the tables big-endian and, on a little-endian machine, flips them in
//!   place once (`rasops_masks_init`, `MBE` over every entry). The tables here are computed
//!   at compile time, already in the byte order of the target (`mbe` is applied by the
//!   `const fn`s that build them), so they are immutable `static`s and
//!   [`rasops_masks_init`] has nothing left to do (the C's own big-endian definition of it
//!   is the empty `do { } while (0)`). The entries are the C's values: the formulas were
//!   checked against every entry of the C source's tables (the part masks are the bits
//!   `x..x + w - 1`, zero where `x + w > 32`, all ones for `x == 0, w == 0`).
//! - `MBL`, `MBR`, `MBE`, `GETBITS` and `PUTBITS` are functions (`mbl`, `mbr`, `mbe`,
//!   `getbits`, `putbits`) instead of macros; `getbits` returns the value the macro stores
//!   in its `dw` argument. `MBE` is `u32::reverse_bits` on little endian (the C's five
//!   mask-and-shift steps) and the identity on big endian (`cfg!(target_endian)`).
//!   `GETBITS`/`PUTBITS` read and write the frame buffer through `fb_r32`/`fb_w32`
//!   (volatile).
//! - `rasops_pmask[x][32]` (a run of a whole word, which `rasops1`'s `putchar` and the
//!   bit operations index with for 32-bit wide runs) is one past the end of the C's row: it
//!   reads the first entry of the next row, zero, so such a run paints nothing. `pmask`
//!   keeps that result (zero past the end of the table, where the C reads whatever follows
//!   it) instead of indexing out of bounds.
