//! 32-bit-per-pixel raster operations: `dev/rasops/rasops32.c` (`rasops32` in GENERIC).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/rasops/rasops32.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Only `putchar` is depth-specific; the row and column operations are rasops's generic
//! word-wide ones.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `rasops32_putchar`'s double-pixel special cases for the common widths (6, 8, 12, 16 and
//!   32 pixels: a table of 64-bit words, two pixels per lookup) are the C's per-pixel default
//!   loop for every width: the pixels written are the same. The glyph row is read `stride`
//!   bytes at a time (at most 4), where the C's default case reads 4 bytes whatever the
//!   stride.
//! - Pixels are stored with `write_volatile` (`rasops.rs`'s deviations).
