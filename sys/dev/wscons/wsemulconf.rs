//! The terminal emulations compiled into the kernel, and their lookup by name.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wsemulconf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `wsemul_conf` lists them in the C's order: `sun` (option `WSEMUL_SUN`), `vt100` (unless
//! option `WSEMUL_NO_VT100`), `dumb` (option `WSEMUL_DUMB`). The first is the default.
//! amd64 and arm64 `GENERIC` set none of these options, so the list is `vt100` alone.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The options are the cargo features `wsemul_dumb` and `wsemul_no_vt100`
//!   (`sys/Cargo.toml`); `WSEMUL_SUN` has none, since `wsemul_sun.c` is not ported (only
//!   sparc64 configurations set it). The emulations themselves are compiled on every build,
//!   so their host tests run; the features only decide what the list offers.
//! - `WSEMUL_DEFAULT` (an option whose value is a name) is [`WSEMUL_DEFAULT`], `None` as in
//!   a kernel without it.
//! - The NULL-terminated array is a slice; `wsemul_pick` returns `None` for the C's NULL and
//!   takes the name as bytes (up to a NUL), `None` for a NULL name.
