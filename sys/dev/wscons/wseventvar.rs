/* <CODE> */
//! `<dev/wscons/wseventvar.h>`: the internal `wscons_event` queue interface for the keyboard
//! and mouse drivers.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wseventvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A [`Wseventvar`] is the ring of [`WsconsEvent`]s a reader of `/dev/wskbd*` or `/dev/wsmux*`
//! gets: the drivers put events at `ws_put` (from interrupt context, under `ws_mtx` at
//! `IPL_TTY`) and [`wsevent_wakeup`] the reader, who takes them from `ws_get` with
//! `wsevent_read` (`wsevent.rs`, with the other functions this header declares). The drivers
//! are expected not to place events in the queue above `spltty()`, i.e., are expected to run
//! off serial ports or similar devices.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The members the C marks `[m]` are `Cell`s, touched only with `ws_mtx` held (the C's
//!   `volatile u_int ws_put` is one too: every access is under the mutex). `ws_q`, the
//!   `malloc`ed ring, is a raw pointer in a `Cell`, null while the queue is closed;
//!   [`Wseventvar::q_write`] and [`Wseventvar::q_events`] reach its slots.
//! - The structure is valid all-zero (it is a member of `M_ZERO` softcs), as in C;
//!   [`Wseventvar::new`] makes the same zeroes for a standalone one.
//! - The prototypes (`wsevent_init`, `wsevent_fini`, `wsevent_read`, `wsevent_kqfilter`)
//!   belong to `wsevent.c`; they are in `wsevent.rs`.
