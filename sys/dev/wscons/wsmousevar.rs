//! `<dev/wscons/wsmousevar.h>`: the interface between mouse drivers and `wsmouse(4)`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wsmousevar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A mouse driver (`ums(4)`, `pms(4)`, a touchpad driver; M16) attaches a `wsmouse` child
//! with a [`WsmousedevAttachArgs`]: its [`WsmouseAccessops`] and the cookie they are called
//! with. It reports input through the functions of `wsmouse.rs`: button states
//! (`wsmouse_buttons`), relative motion (`wsmouse_motion`), absolute coordinates
//! (`wsmouse_position`), single-touch pressure and contacts (`wsmouse_touch`), slot-based
//! (`wsmouse_mtstate`) or point-based (`wsmouse_mtframe`) multitouch, or single values
//! (`wsmouse_set`), and ends each report with `wsmouse_input_sync`, which turns the changes
//! into `wscons_event`s. A driver describes its hardware in the [`Wsmousehw`] of
//! `wsmouse_get_hw` and calls `wsmouse_configure` once.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The access operations are `fn` pointers over the untyped cookie (`wskbdvar.rs`);
//!   `ioctl` takes the kernel copy of the argument as bytes and an `Option<&Proc>` (a mux
//!   passes NULL), and returns `Ok(true)` where the C returns 0, `Ok(false)` where it returns
//!   -1 (not the driver's ioctl) and `Err` for an errno.
//! - The `wsmousedevcf_mux` locator macro is a function of the `cfdata`; a missing locator
//!   reads as the default of `define wsmousedev {[mux = 0]}` in `sys/conf/files`.
//! - `WSMOUSE_INPUT` and `WSMOUSE_TOUCH` are `macro_rules!` of the same names, exported at
//!   the crate root as `unported!` is (their lowercase names would be `wsmouse_touch`'s); `WSMOUSE_IS_MT_CODE` is the `const fn`
//!   [`wsmouse_is_mt_code`].
//! - `enum wsmouseval` and `enum wsmousehw_type` are `i32` constants of the C's names
//!   ([`Wsmouseval`], [`WsmousehwType`]), as `int`s they are in C.
//! - The prototypes belong to `wsmouse.c`; they are in `wsmouse.rs`.
