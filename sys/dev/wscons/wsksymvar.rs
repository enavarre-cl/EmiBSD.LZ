/* <CODE> */
//! `<dev/wscons/wsksymvar.h>`: the keymap types of wscons: a keysym, a keyboard layout code,
//! one entry of a keymap, and the table that describes a keyboard's layouts.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wsksymvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A keyboard driver owns a [`WskbdMapdata`]: its table of [`WsconsKeydesc`]s (one per layout,
//! each the keymap of a code or a delta over a base layout) and the layout in force.
//! `wskbd(4)` turns key codes into keysyms through it.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `keysym_t` and `kbd_t` are [`KeysymT`] (`u16`) and [`KbdT`] (`u32`).
//! - `wscons_keydesc`'s `map` and `map_size` are one slice, `map`; the table of descriptions
//!   (`const struct wscons_keydesc *keydesc`, ended by an entry whose `name` is 0) is a slice
//!   without that last entry, as `cfdata[]` is in `sys/sys/device.rs`. `map_size` stays as the
//!   C's field, equal to `map.len()`.
//! - `wskbd_mapdata.layout` is an `AtomicU32`: a driver changes it at attach (`hidkbd` writes
//!   `ukbd_keymapdata.layout`) through a shared `static`.
//! - The prototypes at the end of the header (`wskbd_get_mapentry`, `wskbd_init_keymap`,
//!   `wskbd_load_keymap`, `wskbd_compose_value`) belong to `wskbdutil.c`; they are
//!   `wskbdutil.rs`'s.
