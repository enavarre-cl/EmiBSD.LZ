//! `<dev/wscons/wskbdvar.h>`: the interface between keyboard drivers and `wskbd(4)`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wskbdvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A keyboard driver (`ukbd(4)`, `pckbd(4)`, ...) attaches a `wskbd` child with a
//! [`WskbddevAttachArgs`]: its [`WskbdAccessops`] (enable, set the LEDs, driver-specific
//! ioctls), the cookie they are called with, the layouts it offers and whether it is the
//! console keyboard (whose [`WskbdConsops`] it hands to `wskbd_cnattach`). It feeds key
//! events to the child with `wskbd_input` and `wskbd_rawinput`. The functions are in
//! `wskbd.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The operation tables are structures of `fn` pointers; the `void *` cookie stays an
//!   untyped pointer (`*mut c_void`), as in `sys/sys/device.rs`. `ioctl` takes the kernel
//!   copy of the argument as a byte slice, and returns `Ok(true)` where the C returns 0,
//!   `Ok(false)` where it returns -1 (not the driver's ioctl, `wskbd` goes on), or the
//!   errno (the convention of `ttioctl` in `kern/tty.rs`); its `struct proc *` is an
//!   `Option<&Proc>`, as a mux passes NULL (`wsmux.c`). `getc`'s two out-parameters are
//!   `&mut`s.
//! - `wskbd_consops`' `debugger` member is an `Option`, as a console keyboard may have none.
//! - The `wskbddevcf_console` and `wskbddevcf_mux` locator macros are functions of the
//!   `cfdata`; a missing locator reads as the default of `define wskbddev {[console = -1],
//!   [mux = 1]}` in `sys/conf/files`.
//! - The prototypes of `wskbd_cnattach`, `wskbd_cndetach`, `wskbddevprint`, `wskbd_input`,
//!   `wskbd_rawinput`, `wskbd_cngetc`, `wskbd_cnpollc` and `wskbd_cnbell` belong to
//!   `wskbd.c`; they are in `wskbd.rs`.
