/* <CODE> */
//! `<dev/wscons/wsemulvar.h>`: the interface between `wsdisplay(4)` and its terminal
//! emulations (`vt100`, `dumb`, `sun`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wsemulvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! An emulation is a [`WsemulOps`] table: `cnattach` and `attach` make its state for a
//! screen (the console's, or a new one) over the screen's emulops and cookie, `output`
//! interprets the bytes written to the screen's tty, `translate` turns a keysym into the
//! bytes the tty reads, `detach` frees the state and `reset` acts on wsdisplay's resets.
//!
//! The tty layer needs a character output to be atomic. Since this may expand to multiple
//! emulops operations, which may fail, each emulation keeps state of its current processing
//! ([`WsemulAbortstate`]), so that if an operation fails, the whole character from the tty
//! layer is reported as not having been output, while it has in fact been partly processed.
//! When the tty layer retransmits the character, this state is used to not retrigger the
//! emulops which have been issued successfully already ([`wsemulop`]). In the particular
//! case where every character was processed but displaying the cursor image back fails, the
//! emulation pretends it could not output the last character; when the tty layer tries
//! again (really to get the cursor image back), that character is skipped
//! (`ABORT_FAILED_CURSOR`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `void *` cookies stay `*mut c_void` and the operations are `unsafe fn`s whose
//!   contract is that the cookie came from the same table's `cnattach`/`attach`
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, a table of function pointers over an opaque `void *` the table's
//!   own constructor made).
//! - `output` takes the bytes as a slice; `attach` takes the screen type as an `Option`
//!   (wsdisplay attaches the console screen with a NULL type) and `console` as a `bool`.
//! - `translate` writes into a buffer the caller passes and returns the bytes, borrowed from
//!   that buffer or from a static string, where the C returns a count and a pointer into the
//!   emulation's state (`translatebuf`): a returned slice cannot borrow from behind the raw
//!   cookie.
//! - `struct wsemul_abortstate`'s anonymous `state` enum is [`WsemulAbort`]; the `static
//!   inline` helpers are free functions; the `WSEMULOP(rc, edp, was, rutin, args)` macro is
//!   [`wsemulop`], which takes the operation as a closure.
//! - An emulation's `emulops` pointer and `emulcookie` are one [`BoundEmulops`], whose
//!   methods call the driver. An operation the driver left NULL (the C calls through it, and
//!   every driver that offers a terminal emulation fills them all) does nothing and succeeds;
//!   a NULL `pack_attr` fails with `ENODEV` (the emulations then keep their default
//!   attribute) and a NULL `mapchar` maps every character to itself with quality 0.
//! - `wsemul_pick`, `wsemul_getname`, `wsemul_getchar` and `wsemul_utf8_translate` are
//!   defined by their `.c` files' modules (`wsemulconf`, `wsemul_subr`) and not repeated
//!   here.
//! - The callbacks into the display interface, `wsdisplay_emulbell` and
//!   `wsdisplay_emulinput`, are defined by `wsdisplay.rs` and re-exported here, where the C
//!   declares them.
