//! `<dev/wscons/wscons_callbacks.h>`: the calls between the wscons glue, the display
//! interface (`wsdisplay.c`) and the keyboard interface (`wskbd.c`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wscons_callbacks.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The header only declares functions; `wsdisplay.c` defines the `wsdisplay_*` ones
//! (`wsdisplay.rs`) and `wskbd.c` the `wskbd_*` ones (`wskbd.rs`), all re-exported here.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct wsevsrc`, which the header only declares, is `<dev/wscons/wsmuxvar.h>`'s
//!   [`Wsevsrc`] (`wsmuxvar.rs`), re-exported here; the pointers to it are
//!   `Option<&Wsevsrc>`.
//! - The `int` results that are 0 or an errno are `Result<(), Errno>`; `wskbd_pickfree`
//!   keeps its index or -1.
