/* <CODE> */
//! `wsmouse(4)`: the wscons mouse driver (`wsmouse* at ums? mux 0`, `/dev/wsmouse*`). Turns
//! the input a mouse or touchpad driver reports into `wscons_event`s for the reader of the
//! mouse or of the mux it is in.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/wscons/wsmouse.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A mouse driver attaches a `wsmouse` child ([`wsmouse_attach`]), which joins the mux its
//! `mux` locator names (`mux 0`, `/dev/wsmouse`). The driver reports its input with
//! [`wsmouse_buttons`], [`wsmouse_motion`], [`wsmouse_position`], [`wsmouse_touch`],
//! [`wsmouse_mtstate`], [`wsmouse_mtframe`] or [`wsmouse_set`], and ends each report with
//! [`wsmouse_input_sync`]: multitouch state becomes single-touch and pointer state (the
//! pointer-controlling slot of [`wsmouse_ptr_ctrl`]), a touchpad in compat mode goes through
//! `wstpad.rs`, and what changed becomes button, motion (scaled, inverted, swapped),
//! scroll and touch events, closed by a `WSCONS_EVENT_SYNC`, in the queue of whoever has
//! the mouse open (directly or through its mux). A full queue drops the frame and sets
//! `RESYNC`, so the next one reports the absolute position again. `WSMOUSEIO_GETPARAMS` and
//! `WSMOUSEIO_SETPARAMS` read and change the filters ([`wsmouse_get_params`],
//! [`wsmouse_set_params`]).
//!
//! In M13 no driver attaches a wsmouse (`ums(4)`, `pms(4)` and the others are M16); the
//! driver interface is proven by host tests over a fake mouse.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The kernel configuration is GENERIC's: `NWSMUX > 0` (the mux paths are compiled);
//!   `WSMUX_DEBUG`'s `DPRINTF`s are not carried; `wsmouseread`'s `DIAGNOSTIC` check is
//!   behind the `diagnostic` feature.
//! - `struct wsmouse_softc` is `#[repr(C)]` with its `Wsevsrc` first and all-zero valid
//!   (`config_make_softc`). `sc_input`, which the driver's reports and the parameter ioctls
//!   change in place, is an `UnsafeCell` handed out by a guard ([`WsmouseSoftc::input`])
//!   that panics on a second live borrow (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`); the C protects it with
//!   `spltty` and the kernel lock. [`wsmouse_get_hw`] returns such a guard too.
//! - The functions a driver calls take its `&Device`, as in C, and work on the input
//!   through the guard; their bodies are methods of `WsmouseInput` named without the
//!   `wsmouse_` prefix (`WsmouseInput::touch`), so that one function calling another
//!   (`wsmouse_set` calls `wsmouse_position`, `wsmouse_mt_convert` calls `wsmouse_touch`)
//!   does not take the guard twice. `wsmouse_mt_convert` takes the input.
//! - `wsmouse_mtframe` takes the points as a slice (`size` is its length).
//! - `wsmouse_mt_init`'s and `wsmouse_configure`'s -1 are `Err(EINVAL)`; `wsmouse_set_mode`
//!   returns `false` for the C's -1 (an unknown mode), which a driver's ioctl turns into its
//!   own -1 (`Ok(false)`, `ENOTTY`) as in C. The parameter functions return `Result`.
//! - `wsmouse_evq_put` writes the event with `ws_mtx` held (the C takes the mutex only to
//!   read `ws_get`): the slot is beyond `ws_put`, so no reader sees it either way, and
//!   `Wseventvar::q_write` asks for the mutex.
//! - The entry points answer `ENXIO` for a minor without a mouse where the C indexes
//!   `wsmouse_cd.cd_devs` unchecked (only `wsmouseopen` checks there).
