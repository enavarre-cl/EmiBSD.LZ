//! `<dev/ofw/openfirm.h>`: the OpenFirmware interface, which `dev/ofw/fdt.c` implements over
//! the device tree blob on this architecture.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/dev/ofw/openfirm.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. The `OF_*` functions live in `dev/ofw/fdt.rs`, as the C implements them
//! there; this module re-exports them and `OFMAXPARAM`. `struct ofprobe`, `struct ofb_softc`
//! (autoconfiguration, M5) and the real-OpenFirmware calls (`OF_call_method`, `OF_open`,
//! `OF_boot`, ...) are for machines with a firmware this kernel does not run on.
