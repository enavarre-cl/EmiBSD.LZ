/* <CODE> */
//! arm64 `<machine/tcb.h>`: the thread control block, which user space reaches through
//! `TPIDR_EL0`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/tcb.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (the kernel half). `cpu_switchto` (`cpuswitch.S`) loads `pcb_tcb` into
//! `TPIDR_EL0` for the thread it switches to; `TCB_SET` also loads it at once, for the
//! running thread.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The macros `TCB_GET(p)`/`TCB_SET(p, addr)` are the functions `tcb_get`/`tcb_set`; the
//!   TCB is a `usize` (a user address the kernel never dereferences) instead of a `void *`.
//! - The userland half (`TLS_VARIANT`, `__aarch64_read_tcb`, the userland `TCB_GET()`) is not
//!   kernel code and is not here.
