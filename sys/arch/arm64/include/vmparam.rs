//! arm64 `<machine/vmparam.h>`: the virtual address space layout.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/vmparam.h @ 3ce1f3f79392

//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 needs the address-space bounds and the physical segment
//! policy; the user limits (`MAXTSIZ`, `DFLDSIZ`, `MAXDSIZ`, `BRKSIZ`, `DFLSSIZ`, `MAXSSIZ`,
//! `STACKGAP_RANDOM`, `USRSTACK`, `VM_MIN_STACK_ADDRESS`); M10a (physio) `USRIOSIZE` and
//! `VM_PHYS_SIZE`; `SHMMAXPGS` is not there yet.
