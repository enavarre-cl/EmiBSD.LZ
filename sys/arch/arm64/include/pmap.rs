//! arm64 `<machine/pmap.h>`: the physical map's types and constants.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/pmap.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 ports `struct pmap` (its kernel subset, with the `pm_vp`
//! tables), `struct vm_page_md`, the `VP_IDX*` layout and the cache and pv flags. The pointer
//! authentication keys and the zero/copy windows arrive with M6.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pm_refs` is an atomic (the C's `atomic_inc_int`/`atomic_dec_int_nv` on an `int`).
//! - `pm_vp` is an enum of the two union members (`l0` for four-level tables, `l1` for three);
//!   the C picks by `have_4_level_pt`.
