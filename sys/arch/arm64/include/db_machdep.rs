//! arm64 `<machine/db_machdep.h>`: machine-dependent defines for new kernel debugger.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/db_machdep.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports `db_regs_t`, `PC_REGS`/`SET_PC_REGS`, the breakpoint
//! instruction, the single-step bit helpers and the `IS_BREAKPOINT_TRAP`/
//! `IS_WATCHPOINT_TRAP` tests; M11c `db_expr_t` and the `inst_*` classifiers (which the C
//! marks "ALL BROKEN!!!": they are never true). `DB_MACHINE_COMMANDS` is defined: the table
//! is `arm64/db_interface.rs`'s. The `DDB_STATE_*` values are here (the multiprocessor
//! entry). The entry points this header declares
//! (`db_ktrap`, `db_machine_init`) live in `arm64/db_interface.rs`; what `ddb/` itself needs
//! is the `machine::DbMachdep` contract.
