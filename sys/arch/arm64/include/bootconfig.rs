//! arm64 `<machine/bootconfig.h>`: what `locore0.S` hands the kernel's first C.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/bootconfig.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `initarm(struct arm64_bootparams *)` is not declared here: the C's `locore0.S` calls
//!   `initarm` with the parameters, here it calls the boot glue's `bootarg_main`
//!   (`sys/stand/bootarg.rs`), which hands them to `machdep.rs`'s `getbootinfo` and runs
//!   `initarm` (with a `BootInfo`) like the Limine entry does.

/// `struct arm64_bootparams`: `locore0.S` builds it on the boot stack.
