//! arm64 `<machine/fdt.h>`: the device-tree attach arguments and the `fdt_intr_*` names.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/fdt.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports `struct fdt_attach_args` and the `fdt_intr_*` aliases
//! of the `arm_intr_*_fdt` functions that exist; `stdout_node`, `stdout_speed`,
//! `fdt_cons_bs_tag` and `fdt_find_cons` are `arm64/machdep.rs` (and the `machine::fdt`
//! contract). M12 adds the `imap`/`msi` aliases, with PCI.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `fa_reg`/`fa_nreg` and `fa_intr`/`fa_nintr` are slices; `fa_name` is a byte string.
