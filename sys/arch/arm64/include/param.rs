//! arm64 `<machine/param.h>`: machine type and page geometry.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/param.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The constants are exported to generic code through the [`MachineParam`] implementation at the
//! bottom, re-exported by `sys::param`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `_MACHINE` and `_MACHINE_ARCH` (unquoted tokens for the preprocessor) have no counterpart.
//! - `MID_MACHINE` (`MID_ARM64`) arrives with `sys/sys/exec.h`.
//! - `STACKALIGN(p)` is the function [`stackalign`].
//! - The `<machine/cpu.h>` include is not reproduced; that header is a module of its own when
//!   ported.
