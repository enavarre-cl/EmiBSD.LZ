//! arm64 `<machine/simplebusvar.h>`: the softc of a `simple-bus` node, which the interrupt
//! controllers that have children (`ampintc`'s GICv2m frames) embed first.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/simplebusvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `extern void simplebus_attach(...)` is `arch/arm64/dev/simplebus.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `sc_bus` and `sc_dma`, the copies of the parent's tags that the children get, are
//!   `MaybeUninit` behind an `UnsafeCell`: the softc is zeroed memory, which is no valid table
//!   of function pointers, and `simplebus_attach` writes them once before any child sees
//!   them ([`SimplebusSoftc::bus`], [`SimplebusSoftc::dma`]).
//! - The tags and the range arrays are `Cell`s (`Option` for the tags, raw pointers for the
//!   `malloc`ed `int *` arrays), written by `simplebus_attach`.
