//! arm64 `<machine/efivar.h>`: the efi(4) softc.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/efivar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `sc_todr` is a pointer to a `malloc`ed chip handle: a zero-filled softc (what
//!   `config_attach` makes) cannot hold a `TodrChipHandle`, whose functions are not
//!   nullable.
//! - `efi_enter`, `efi_leave` and `efi_jmpbuf` are defined in `efi_machdep.rs` (as in C);
//!   `efi_enter_check`, a `setjmp`, is `efi_machdep.rs`'s `efi_call`, which makes the
//!   runtime-service call through an assembly trampoline that saves the registers in
//!   `efi_jmpbuf`, so that `efi_fault` can return `EFAULT` from it.
//! - `efi_get_variable`, `efi_set_variable` and `efi_get_next_variable_name` are
//!   `dev/efi/efi.c`'s, which is not ported.
