//! arm64 `<machine/hypervisor.h>`: the EL2 registers' bit definitions.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/include/hypervisor.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. M14 (track A3) ports what `locore.S`'s `drop_to_el1` writes when boot(8)
//! enters the kernel at EL2: `CPTR_RES1` and the `HCR_EL2` bits `HCR_TGE`, `HCR_RW`,
//! `HCR_E2H`, `HCR_APK` and `HCR_API`. The rest (the trap, translation and debug
//! registers of a hypervisor) comes with vmm(4).

/// `CPTR_RES1`: the bits of `CPTR_EL2` that read as one.
