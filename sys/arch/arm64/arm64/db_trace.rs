//! arm64 stack traces for `ddb(4)`: `arch/arm64/arm64/db_trace.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/arm64/db_trace.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 ports `db_stack_trace_print` for the "trace from this frame"
//! case `db_stack_dump` needs; M4 adds the trace from `ddb_regs` (a trap frame). The `/t`
//! thread trace (`tfind`, `switchframe`), `stacktrace_save_at` and `stacktrace_save_utrace`
//! arrive with the scheduler (M5).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - No symbol table in memory yet (`db_search_symbol`, `db_printsym`): every frame prints
//!   its return addresses as numbers, as the C does for an address without a symbol, and the
//!   "--- interrupt ---" / "--- trap ---" markers, which hinge on symbol names, cannot appear.
//!   `cargo xtask symbolize` turns the addresses into names offline.
//! - `db_get_value` is a plain read: the faulting-read protection of `db_read_bytes` arrives
//!   with M4. The checks against the previous frame are the same as the C's.
//! - The C decrements `count` twice per frame (`while (count--)` and `--count`); so does
//!   this, on a signed counter, so the two behave alike at the limit.
