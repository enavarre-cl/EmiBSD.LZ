//! arm64 machine-dependent setup and shutdown: `arch/arm64/arm64/machdep.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/arm64/machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 ports what the console and a panic need: the part of `initarm`
//! that brings up the message buffer and the console, `consinit`, `boot`, `cold`, `waittime`,
//! `cpuresetfn` and `powerdownfn`; M3 adds the memory setup and `pmap_bootstrap`; M4 adds
//! `cpu_info_primary`, the per-CPU pointer and vector table setup of `initarm`, `fdt_init`
//! of the bootloader's device tree, `stdout_node`/`stdout_speed`, `fdt_find_cons` and the
//! console's receive interrupt.
//! `cpu_info[]`, the FDT setup, `dumpsys`, `sendsig`/`setregs`, the sysctl tree and the
//! bootstrap KVA helpers arrive with M4-b to M6. M11a adds `cpu_info[]`,
//! `cpu_idle_cycle_fcn`, `need_resched`'s `cpu_kick`, the `MULTIPROCESSOR` `signotify`
//! (`aston` and `cpu_unidle(p->p_cpu)`) and keeps the boot protocol's processors
//! (`BOOT_MP`) for `cpu_start_secondary`; `cpu_unidle` moved to `cpu.rs`, where the C has it.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `cpu_sysctl` (M13, `machine::cpu::cpu_sysctl`) is ported whole. `CPU_LED_BLINK` does not
//!   call `blink_led_timeout` when it turns on: with no `blink_led` registered (the LED
//!   drivers and `blink_led_register` are not ported) the C returns from it at once.
//!   `lid_action` is a static here that nothing reads until `aplsmc` is ported.
//! - Limine has set up EL1, the MMU and the direct map before `initarm` runs, so the C's
//!   page-table and memory-map work is replaced by the boot protocol (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
//!   What Limine does not map is device memory: `initarm` installs one 1 GiB identity block of
//!   Device-nGnRnE memory in `TTBR0_EL1` (the lower half, which the protocol leaves to the
//!   kernel), through `MAIR_EL1` attribute 2, so `bus_space` can reach the PL011. `pmap` (M3)
//!   replaces it.
//! - The physical memory handed to `uvm` is the boot protocol's usable regions, which already
//!   exclude the kernel, the device tree, the initrd and the bootloader's own data: the
//!   `memreg_add`/`memreg_remove` bookkeeping, the EFI memory map walk, `pmap_avail_fixup`
//!   and `pmap_physload_avail` have nothing left to do, and the direct map `pmap` uses is the
//!   bootloader's (`arm64/pmap.rs`, deviations). The memory is loaded before `pmap_bootstrap`
//!   (after it in the C) because `pmap_bootstrap` steals its tables from `vm_physmem[]`.
//! - The message buffer is a static area (`kern/subr_log.rs`, `init_static_msgbuf`) instead of
//!   reserved physical pages, until M3.
//! - `cpu_startup` prints the memory sizes, makes the exec and physio maps and sets up the
//!   buffer cache (`bufinit`); `cpu_init_extents` and `cpu_init_idt` are not there yet.
//! - `initarm` sets `VBAR_EL1` itself (the C's `locore.S` does, before `initarm`) and sets
//!   `tpidr_el1` first thing instead of after the pmap bootstrap, so `curcpu()` and the
//!   exception vectors work for everything that follows; `x18` is not loaded, as it is a
//!   general register here (`arm64/exception.rs`, deviations).
//! - `consinit` runs `pluart_init_cons` only: the other `*_init_cons` are drivers for hardware
//!   QEMU does not have (`deferred-driver`). The console's receive interrupt is
//!   `pluart_fdt_attach`'s since M8 (`pluart* at fdt?`).
//! - `boot`: under feature `qemu`, the wait for a key after "The operating system has halted"
//!   is the emulator exit with the failure status, which `xtask smoke` checks after a panic.
//!   `resettodr`, `if_downall`, `uvm_shutdown`, `dumpsys` and `config_suspend_all` are
//!   reported as unported when reached (`vfs_shutdown` is real since M14; with no thread on
//!   the CPU, which the C cannot have there, it is skipped).
//! - The UEFI system table and memory map come from the boot protocol (`BootInfo`) instead
//!   of efiboot's `openbsd,uefi-*` properties in `/chosen`; the system table's address is
//!   kept in `SYSTEM_TABLE` (a local in C) for `mainbus` and `efi_attach`, and the memory
//!   map is relocated into a static buffer (`MMAP`) instead of stolen pages.
//! - The bootargs parsing (`-a -c -d -s`) is `BootInfo::boothowto` in `sys/machine/bootinfo.rs`,
//!   because the Limine command line serves both architectures.
//! - boot(8)'s entry (M14, `locore0.rs`): `getbootinfo` is the half of `initarm` that reads
//!   efiboot's `/chosen` and the memory (`collect_kernel_args`, `process_kernel_args`,
//!   `memreg_add`, `memreg_remove`, the EFI memory map walk, `/reserved-memory`, the 64 MB
//!   block), into the `BootInfo` the rest of `initarm` takes from either entry. The device
//!   tree and the EFI memory map are read in place through `locore0.S`'s direct map (efiboot
//!   leaves them in loader data, which is never given to uvm) instead of being mapped at the
//!   first free KVA and copied to stolen pages; the direct map gains the gigabytes of RAM
//!   there (`bootarg_direct_map`, not in the C; memory it cannot reach, past 512 GB, is
//!   listed as reserved). `openbsd,dma-constraint` is read but `dma_constraint` is a
//!   constant (every address): a narrower one is reported by `initarm`. The processors come
//!   from `/cpus` and start by psci(4)'s `psci_cpu_on` (`bootarg_mp_start`).
//! - `cpu_info[]` holds `CiPtr`s; `cpu_idle_cycle_fcn` is a `StaticCell` written at attach
//!   time; `BOOT_MP` (`MULTIPROCESSOR`) has no C counterpart: PSCI or a spin table in the C
//!   (`cpu.rs`, deviations).
