//! arm64 TLB and cache maintenance: `arch/arm64/arm64/cpufunc_asm.S`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/arm64/cpufunc_asm.S @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 ports the TLB invalidations (`cpu_tlb_flush`,
//! `cpu_tlb_flush_asid`, `cpu_tlb_flush_all_asid`, `cpu_tlb_flush_asid_all`) and `cpu_setttb`.
//! M6 adds `cpu_icache_sync_range`, which reads the line sizes from `CTR_EL0` itself (the
//! C takes them from `cpu.c`'s probe). M7b adds `cpu_dcache_wb_range`,
//! `cpu_dcache_wbinv_range` and `cpu_dcache_inv_range` for `bus_dma`, which read
//! `dcache_line_size` from `CTR_EL0` the same way. M16f adds `cpu_idcache_wbinv_range`, for
//! `pmap_kenter_cache`'s non-cacheable mappings of managed pages (agintc's LPI and ITS
//! tables), with `idcache_line_size` from `CTR_EL0` too.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - Each routine is an `asm!` block instead of a `.S` entry: they are a few instructions each
//!   and have no stack frame; the `RETGUARD` prologue has no meaning in Rust.
//! - The `CPTAG_REPEAT_TLBI` code patch (an erratum workaround that repeats the `tlbi` at
//!   run time on affected cores) waits for `codepatch` (M4).
