//! arm64 signal delivery: `arch/arm64/arm64/sig_machdep.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/arm64/sig_machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (with `kern_sig.c`): `process_frame`, `sendsig` and `sys_sigreturn`.
//! `sys_sigreturn` is reached through `machine::MachineSignal` from the system call table's
//! entry in `kern/kern_sig.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The floating-point context is not saved here, as in C ("XXX"): the trampoline
//!   (`sigcode`, `locore.S`) saves and restores the `q` registers on the user stack.
//! - The 4-clause licence (advertising clause) of the first block was accepted by the user
//!   at M2 for this project.
