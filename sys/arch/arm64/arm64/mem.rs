//! The memory special file (`/dev/mem`, `/dev/kmem`, `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`):
//! `arch/arm64/arm64/mem.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/arm64/mem.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `option APERTURE` (minor 4) is not configured.
//! - `/dev/mem` (minor 0): the C maps each physical page at `vmmap` (one reserved page) with
//!   `pmap_enter` under `physlock`. Here `vmmap` is the device mapping window
//!   (`arm64/pmap.rs`), and the kernel has a direct map, which the C's arm64 does not; the
//!   page is reached through it, a page at a time under `physlock` as in C, and copied
//!   through a small buffer with `kcopy`, so an address with nothing behind it fails with
//!   `EFAULT`.
//! - `/dev/kmem` (minor 1) checks the range with `uvm_kernacc` (`uvm_glue.c`), which is not
//!   ported: the read or write is reported and fails.
//! - `/dev/zero` reads come from a zeroed buffer on the stack, `MEM_CHUNK` bytes per step,
//!   instead of the shared `malloc`ed `zeropage` (a slice of it per reader would alias).
