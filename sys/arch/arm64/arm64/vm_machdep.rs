//! arm64 `vm_machdep.c`: the machine-dependent part of creating and tearing down threads.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/arm64/vm_machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M5 (part b2) ports `cpu_fork` and `cpu_exit`; M10a adds physio's
//! `kv_physwait`, `vmapbuf` and `vunmapbuf`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The pointer authentication keys (`pm_ap*key`) the C copies from the parent's pmap wait
//!   for user pmaps (M6): kernel threads share the kernel pmap.
//! - The switch frame's `sf_x19` holds the thread function as a pointer, which
//!   `proc_trampoline_run` (`cpuswitch.rs`) turns back into a Rust `fn`: Rust function
//!   pointers have no C calling convention to `blr` from assembly.
//! - `vmapbuf` panics if a user page of the request is not mapped, where the C enters the
//!   uninitialised address `pmap_extract` left (the pages are wired, so it cannot happen).
