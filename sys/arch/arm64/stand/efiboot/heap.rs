//! `heap.h`: libsa's allocator gets efiboot's heap: it starts at the pages `efi_heap_init`
//! allocated.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/stand/efiboot/heap.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `heap_init()`, which `alloc()` calls on every call in C (`NEEDS_HEAP_INIT`) and which
//!   sets `top` the first time, is called once by `efi_heap_init`, right after the pages are
//!   allocated, and hands libsa the start and the end of the heap (`alloc.rs`'s
//!   `heap_init`).
//! - arm64's efiboot defines no `HEAP_LIMIT`, so the C's `alloc()` carves past the heap's
//!   pages unchecked; libsa's allocator always checks a limit, which is the end of the
//!   pages here (`heap + heapsiz`): running out panics ("heap full") instead of writing over
//!   memory the firmware may own.
