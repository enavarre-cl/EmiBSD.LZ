/* <CODE> */
//! BOOTAA64.EFI's first bytes and first instructions: the PE32+ header the firmware reads
//! and `_start`, which clears the bss, relocates the image and calls `efi_main`
//! (`start.S`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/arm64/stand/efiboot/start.S @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! (with sys/arch/arm64/stand/efiboot/ldscript.arm64 @ 3ce1f3f79392, which `build.rs` hands
//! the linker as `ldscript.arm64`: the image layout `start.S`'s header describes)
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The C preprocessor's `#define`s are `.set`s (`global_asm!` runs no cpp).
//! - `adr` is `adrp`/`add :lo12:` for the bss bounds, `ImageBase` and `_DYNAMIC`: `adr`
//!   reaches 1 MB, which the debug image passes.
//! - The device tree blob the C assembles at the end of `.data` (`#include "dt_blob.S"`) is
//!   `dt_blob.rs`.
