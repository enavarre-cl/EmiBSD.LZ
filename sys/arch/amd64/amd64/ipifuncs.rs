/* <CODE> */
//! Interprocessor interrupt handlers: `arch/amd64/amd64/ipifuncs.c` (`MULTIPROCESSOR`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/ipifuncs.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `ipifunc[]` maps each `X86_IPI_*` bit to what the receiving CPU does
//! (`x86_ipi_handler`, `ipi.rs`): halt, nothing (the NOP that only wakes an idle CPU), write
//! back the caches, ...
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The entries for subsystems that are not ported are visible stubs:
//!   `x86_64_ipi_reload_mtrr` (option `MTRR`: `amd64_mem.c`'s `mem_range_softc` is not
//!   ported), `x86_setperf_ipi` (`mp_setperf.c`) and `x86_64_ipi_xcall` (`kern_xcall.c`:
//!   the C posts `SIR_XCALL`, whose `Xxcallintr` source does not exist here, so the stub
//!   posts nothing). `NVMM` and `NPCTR` are not configured: their entries are `None`, as the
//!   C's `NULL`. `x86_ipi_db` is `db_interface.rs`'s, as in the C (M11c).
//! - `x86_64_ipi_halt` waits in `cpu_suspend_cycle_fcn` when acpicpu(4) installed one
//!   (`acpicpu_suspend`, M16e), as the C does, and on `hlt` otherwise.
