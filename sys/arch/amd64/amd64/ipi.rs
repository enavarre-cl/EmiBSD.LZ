//! Sending and taking inter-processor interrupts: `arch/amd64/amd64/ipi.c`
//! (`MULTIPROCESSOR`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/ipi.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `x86_send_ipi` posts IPI bits (`X86_IPI_*`) in the target's `ci_ipis` and sends
//! `LAPIC_IPI_VECTOR`; the target's `Xintr_lapic_ipi` (`vector.S`) calls `x86_ipi_handler`
//! at `IPL_IPI`, which runs `ipifunc[]` (`ipifuncs.rs`) for each bit. `x86_fast_ipi` sends
//! one of the vectors that have a stub of their own (the TLB shootdowns).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `x86_fast_ipi` returns `Result<(), Errno>` (`ENOENT` for a CPU that is not running)
//!   instead of an `int`.
//! - `x86_ipi_selftest` is not in the C: the boot check (feature `qemu`) that every running
//!   application processor takes a `X86_IPI_NOP` and acknowledges the TLB shootdowns of a
//!   kernel page and of a range; `cpu_boot_secondary_processors` calls it.
