//! Per-CPU global descriptor tables: `arch/amd64/amd64/gdt.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/gdt.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `gdt_init_cpu` points the CPU's own GDT (`ci_gdt`, a copy of the boot CPU's that
//! `cpu_attach` made) at its own TSS and loads both. The boot CPU's GDT is built by
//! `init_x86_64` (`machdep.rs`); an application processor calls this from `cpu_hatch`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `lgdt` (`locore.S`) also reloads the data and code selectors, which the C's `lgdt` does
//!   too; an application processor arrives with the bootloader's GDT (`stand`), so this is
//!   what moves it onto the kernel's selectors.
