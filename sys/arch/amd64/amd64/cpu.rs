//! amd64 CPU attachment and per-CPU setup: `arch/amd64/amd64/cpu.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/cpu.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports `cpu_info_full_primary`,
//! `cpu_init_msrs` and `cpu_enter_pages`'s TSS part; M7b the `cpu` device (`struct
//! cpu_softc`, `cpu_ca`, `cpu_cd`, `cpu_match`, `cpu_attach`) for autoconfiguration, with
//! `cpu_init`. M11a ports the `MULTIPROCESSOR` half: `cpu_info[]`, `mp_cpu_funcs`
//! (`mp_cpu_start`, `mp_cpu_start_cleanup`), the application processor's `cpu_attach`
//! (its `cpu_info_full`, idle pcb, `sched_init_cpu`, `ncpus`, `cpu_info_list`),
//! `cpu_boot_secondary_processors`, `cpu_start_secondary`, `cpu_boot_secondary`,
//! `cpu_hatch`, `cpu_init`'s `CPUF_RUNNING` and `wbinvd_on_all_cpus`. `patinit`, the
//! MDS/`cpu_fix_msrs` work and `cpu_debug_dump` (ddb, M11c) come later. M16e ports
//! `cpu_init_mwait` and `cpu_idle_mwait_cycle` (with `cpu_mwait_size`/`cpu_mwait_states`),
//! for acpicpu(4)'s idle states.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `cpu_attach` reports what it cannot do yet: `cpu_fix_msrs`,
//!   `mem_range_attach` (`MTRR`) and `cpu_init_vmm`. Without
//!   `MULTIPROCESSOR` an application processor (never attached: mainbus attaches the boot
//!   CPU alone) is reported instead of getting a `km_alloc`ed `cpu_info_full`. `cpu_ca` has
//!   no `cpu_activate` (suspend/resume): `config_suspend` walks the CPU's children instead.
//! - `MULTIPROCESSOR` after a boot by boot(8) (M14): the processors are the MADT's enabled
//!   LAPIC/x2APIC entries (`mp_madt_cpus`, standing for acpimadt0 before autoconfiguration),
//!   and `BootMp::start` is the C's `mp_cpu_start` (`mp_cpu_start_tramp`: NVRAM reset code,
//!   the 40:67 vector written through the direct map, INIT, two STARTUP IPIs), the
//!   processor running `mptramp.S` into `cpu_hatch`, which loads the IDT after `CPUF_GO` as
//!   in C. `cpu_start_secondary` maps the trampoline pages and `mp_cpu_start_cleanup`
//!   restores the NVRAM byte, as in C.
//! - `MULTIPROCESSOR` under Limine: the bootloader starts the application processors
//!   (`stand`, Limine's MP request), so `mp_cpu_start` (`CPU_STARTUP`) is
//!   `BootMp::start` for the processor whose hardware ID is `ci_apicid`, with the
//!   `cpu_info` as its argument, in place of the warm-reset vector and the INIT/STARTUP
//!   IPIs; `mp_cpu_start_cleanup` has no NVRAM reset byte to restore. `init_x86_64` keeps the
//!   `BootMp` (`BOOT_MP`). The processor enters `cpu_hatch_entry` (`Cpu::cpu_hatch`) on the
//!   bootloader's 64 KiB stack, in long mode on the bootloader's GDT, with no IDT and
//!   interrupts masked; `cpu_hatch_entry` does what `mptramp.S`'s `cpu_spinup_finish` did
//!   (x2APIC mode when the boot CPU runs it, the CPU's own GDT, `CR3` = the kernel pmap,
//!   `CR0_DEFAULT`, `EFER.NXE` when `CPUID` has it, the idle pcb's stack) and loads the IDT
//!   first, before anything can fault: the C loads it in `cpu_hatch`, after `CPUF_GO`.
//! - The TSC synchronisation test (`tsc_test_sync_bp`/`tsc_test_sync_ap`) runs where the C
//!   runs it (M11b); under feature `qemu` `cpu_start_secondary` then prints a verdict line
//!   per application processor (`tsc.rs`'s deviations). `cpu_ucode_apply`, `cpu_tsx_disable`
//!   and the AP's `cpu_fix_msrs` are reported; `HIBERNATE`, `NPVBUS` and the memory range
//!   `initAP` are not configured. `mp_verbose` is off.
//! - `cpu_boot_secondary_processors` ends with `x86_ipi_selftest` under feature `qemu`
//!   (not in the C, `ipi.rs`).
//! - `cpu_init` sets `CR4_DEFAULT` (with `CR4_OSFXSR`: user SSE) and fills
//!   `fpu_cleandata`. Its CPUID-dependent bits wait for `identifycpu`: `CR4_SMEP`,
//!   `CR4_SMAP`, `CR4_UMIP`, `CR4_PKE` (`pg_xo`), `CR4_PCIDE` (`pmap_use_pcid` is 0) and the
//!   XSAVE setup (`CR4_OSXSAVE`, `xsave_mask`, `fpu_save_len`, XSAVES), reported; the FPU
//!   then uses `fxsave` (`amd64/fpu.rs`). `cpu_setup` (vendor quirks) is identcpu's.
//! - `cpu_match`'s SEV-ES check (`cpu_sev_guestmode`, not ported) only refuses units 1 and
//!   up, which `MAXCPUS` (1 without `MULTIPROCESSOR`) has already refused.
//! - `cpu_init_msrs` writes 0 to `MSR_LSTAR`: there is no `Xsyscall` until user mode (M6).
//!   `patinit` (the PAT MSR for write-combining) is reported as unported.
//! - `cpu_enter_pages` sets up the TSS stacks only: `pmap_enter_special` (the u-k mappings of
//!   the Meltdown mitigation) waits for M6.
