/* <CODE> */
//! The I/O APIC (Intel 82093AA): `arch/amd64/amd64/ioapic.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/ioapic.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `acpimadt` (or `mpbios`) attaches one `ioapic` per I/O APIC at mainbus. Each is a `struct
//! pic` whose pins `intr_establish` routes: while `ioapic_cold`, `ioapic_addroute` only
//! records the pin's vector, type and CPU; `ioapic_enable` (`cpu_configure`, after mainbus)
//! then programs every recorded pin, after which routes are written as they are added. The
//! interrupt stubs (`ioapic_edge_stubs`, `ioapic_level_stubs`, `vector.S`) acknowledge at
//! the local APIC and mask a level-triggered pin while its handler is deferred.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The softc's `struct pic` is reached by offset (`i82093var.rs`): `ioapic_from_pic` is the
//!   C's `(struct ioapic_softc *)pic` cast. Its name is the device's `dv_xname`.
//! - `ioapic_hwmask`/`ioapic_hwunmask` are `extern "C"` under their C names, because the
//!   level stubs call them (`ioapic_mask`/`ioapic_unmask` in `vector.S`); the pic's
//!   `pic_hwmask`/`pic_hwunmask` are Rust-ABI shims around them.
//! - `ioapic_find(MPS_ALL_APICS)` with more than one I/O APIC panics, as the C does.
//! - `ioapic_activate` returns `Ok(())` (`ca_activate`'s `Result`), the C's 0.
//! - `ioapic_attach` adds the softc to `ioapics` once its registers are mapped and its pic
//!   is set up (the C adds it first): `ioapic_find` hands out only usable I/O APICs, and a
//!   failed map leaves none behind.
//! - The pins are `mallocarray`ed with `M_WAITOK` as in C; a failed allocation panics.
