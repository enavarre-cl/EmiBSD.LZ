//! amd64 physical map: `arch/amd64/amd64/pmap.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/pmap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! This is the i386 pmap modified and generalized to support x86-64 as well. The idea is to
//! hide the upper N levels of the page tables inside `pmap_get_ptp`, `pmap_free_ptp` and
//! `pmap_growkernel`. The rest is mostly untouched, except that it uses some more generalized
//! macros and interfaces.
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 ports what the kernel's own memory needs before user space
//! exists: the direct map (`PMAP_DIRECT_MAP`, `pmap_map_direct`), `pmap_bootstrap`'s
//! kernel-pmap setup with the recursive mapping, `pmap_steal_memory`, `pmap_zero_page`,
//! `pmap_copy_page`, `pmap_init`, the kernel mapping functions (`pmap_kenter_pa`,
//! `pmap_kremove`, `pmap_extract`, `pmap_pdes_valid`, `pmap_find_pte_direct`),
//! `pmap_growkernel` with `pmap_alloc_level`/`pmap_get_physpage`, and the single-CPU TLB
//! shootdowns; M11a the `MULTIPROCESSOR` shootdowns (`tlb_shoot_lock` .. `tlb_shoot_addr2`,
//! `pmap_is_active`, `pmap_start_tlb_shoot`, `pmap_tlb_shootwait`, `pmap_tlb_shootfail` and
//! the IPI halves of `pmap_tlb_shootpage`/`shootrange`/`shoottlb`). The user pmaps (`pmap_create`, `pmap_enter`, `pmap_remove`, the pv lists, the
//! PTP management, `pmap_map_ptes`), PCID, `pmap_randomize` and the MP shootdowns come with
//! M4 to M6.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pmap_direct_base` is the bootloader's higher-half direct map (`BootInfo::hhdm_offset`),
//!   set by `init_x86_64` where the C's `init_x86_64` derives it from `L4_SLOT_DIRECT`;
//!   `pmap_bootstrap` does not build the direct map's page tables (`dmpdp`/`dmpd`): the
//!   bootloader's serve until the kernel owns its page tables. Limine maps at least 4 GiB and
//!   every memory-map region, which is all `pmap_steal_memory` and the page allocator touch.
//! - After a boot by boot(8) (M14), the direct map, the kernel's PML4 and its recursive slot
//!   are `locore0.S`'s, as in C (`pmap_direct_base` without `pmap_direct_rand`), and only its
//!   first 4 GB exist: the part of `pmap_bootstrap` that maps the rest is not ported.
//!   `pmap_prealloc_lowmem_ptps` runs then, for the MP trampoline.
//! - Under Limine, the kernel runs on the bootloader's PML4 (`CR3`), which `pmap_bootstrap` adopts as
//!   `pm_pdir` (the C's is `proc0`'s, built by `locore0.S`); it installs the recursive mapping
//!   in `PDIR_SLOT_PTE` itself, where the C's `locore0.S` does.
//! - The managed kernel range starts at `virtual_avail`, above the direct map, when that map
//!   sits inside `[VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS, VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS)` as Limine's default
//!   placement does; `pmap_growkernel` counts its PTPs from there (`pmap_kva_start`), not from
//!   `VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS`, and `pmap_alloc_level` keeps the page-table pages the bootloader
//!   already installed on the way (the direct map shares the PML4 slot). A large page met
//!   there is a panic. The window keeps the C's size: `pmap_virtual_space` ends at
//!   `pmap_kva_start + (VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS - VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS)` and `pmap_bootstrap`
//!   moves `uvm`'s runtime `vm_min_kernel_address` (the kernel map's base) up to
//!   `virtual_avail`, so the kernel map is `[virtual_avail, virtual_avail + 512 GiB)`.
//! - `pg_nx` comes from `EFER.NXE` as the bootloader left it; the C's `locore0.S` probes CPUID
//!   and enables it. `pg_g_kern`, `pg_xo` (PKU), `pg_crypt` (SEV) and `pmap_pg_wc` (PAT) keep
//!   their "not available" values until CPU identification (M4); PCID is off.
//! - `pmap_steal_memory`'s `vm_physmem[]` bookkeeping is `uvm_page_physsteal`
//!   (`uvm/uvm_page.rs`), shared with arm64 and the host double; the direct-map half is here.
//! - `pagezero` (`locore.S`) is `ptr::write_bytes`.
//! - `pmap_virtual_space` is not in the C (amd64 has `PMAP_STEAL_MEMORY`); the trait needs one
//!   and it reports the range `pmap_steal_memory` reports.
//! - User pmaps (M6): `pmap_create`/`pmap_destroy`/`pmap_enter`/`pmap_remove` walk the
//!   tables through the direct map instead of the recursive mapping of a borrowed `%cr3`, so
//!   `pmap_map_ptes`/`pmap_unmap_ptes` only take and release the pmap's `pm_mtx` (M11e: where
//!   the C calls them, with the same lock windows) and switch no `%cr3`;
//!   `pmap_pdes_valid`/`normal_pdes` are only used on the current pmap.
//!   `pmap_pdp_ctor` copies the kernel's whole upper half of the PML4 (the C copies the kernel
//!   VM, direct-map and `KERNBASE` slots one by one). The pmap list (`pmaps`) waits
//!   for `pmap_growkernel` to need it. The PDP comes from `uvm_pagealloc` rather than `pmap_pdp_pool`; the pmap pool is
//!   initialised in `pmap_init`. `cpu_meltdown` is not configured: no `pm_pdir_intel`.
//! - The pv lists (M7a): `pmap_page_remove`, `pmap_test_attrs`, `pmap_clear_attrs` and
//!   `pmap_write_protect` reach each PTE through `pmap_find_pte_direct` instead of
//!   `PTE_BASE` under `pmap_map_ptes`. `pmap_remove_pte` (the single-page shortcut of
//!   `pmap_do_remove`) is folded into the block loop over `pmap_remove_ptes`.
//! - The `MULTIPROCESSOR` shootdowns: the globals are plain statics (`.kudata`, the u-k
//!   mapping of the Meltdown mitigation, is M6), each on its own cache line as in C; the
//!   targets' bit mask is built by `pmap_tlb_shoot_targets` and the IPIs sent by
//!   `pmap_tlb_shoot_send`, the two `CPU_INFO_FOREACH` loops the three C functions repeat.
//!   `tlb_shoot_first_pcid` and the PCID/EPT variants are not there (`pmap_use_pcid` is
//!   never set, `NVMM` is not configured).
//! - `pmap_growkernel` has no user pmaps to update yet (`pmaps`, M6); the `splhigh` around
//!   it waits for `spl(9)` (M4). `pmap_get_physpage` after `uvm_init` allocates the PTP from
//!   `pm_obj`, whose objects have no pager yet.
