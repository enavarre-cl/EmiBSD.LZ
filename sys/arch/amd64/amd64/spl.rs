/* <CODE> */
//! The spl loops of `arch/amd64/amd64/spl.S`, pulled in from the `.S` file next to this
//! module (the file keeps OpenBSD's licence blocks and layout; `NAME` between braces is what
//! `assym.h` provides in C).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/spl.S @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. `Xspllower` and `Xdoreti`; the `#if 0` profiling `splhigh`/`splx` are
//! dead code in C too.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - No `RETGUARD_*` (an OpenBSD compiler feature), no `_PROF_PROLOGUE` (no `GPROF`), and the
//!   `retpoline_rax` thunk (a `CODEPATCH`ed Spectre mitigation) is a plain `jmp *%rax`:
//!   `codepatch.c` is not ported.
//! - `intr_user_exit` is `locore.S`'s stub until user mode (M6).
//! - AT&T syntax, as the C file, so the two can be diffed.
