//! amd64's disk label I/O: `arch/amd64/amd64/disksubr.c` (`readdisklabel`,
//! `writedisklabel`), reached through `machine::disklabel`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/disksubr.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `spoofonly` is a `bool`; the functions return `Result` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
//! - The BIOS geometry `readdisklabel` honours (`bios_getdiskinfo`, `<machine/biosvar.h>`)
//!   does not exist: the kernel boots through Limine on UEFI, without `boot(8)`'s
//!   `bios_diskinfo` list (`skipped: replaced-by-limine`), so the driver's geometry stands,
//!   as on arm64.
