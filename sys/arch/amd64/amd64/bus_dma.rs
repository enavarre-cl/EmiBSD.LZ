//! amd64 `bus_dma(9)`: the common DMA map and DMA memory functions every amd64 bus tag uses,
//! `arch/amd64/amd64/bus_dma.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/bus_dma.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A map translates a buffer (linear, an mbuf chain, a `uio`, or raw segments from
//! `bus_dmamem_alloc`) into physical segments a device can be programmed with, coalescing
//! physically contiguous pages and splitting at `_dm_maxsegsz` and `_dm_boundary`. A device
//! that cannot address all of memory (no `BUS_DMA_64BIT`) gets a map with bounce pages below
//! `dma_constraint` when there is memory above it; `_bus_dmamap_sync` copies between the
//! buffer and the bounce pages. amd64 caches are coherent with DMA, so a sync does nothing
//! else.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The C's `NKSTAT` statistics (`bus_dma_kstat_copy` and the `mainbus0` "dma" kstat that
//!   `bus_dma_init` creates) need `kstat(4)` (`kern/subr_kstat.c`, not ported): the counters
//!   exist, the kstat is reported.
//! - `cpu_sev_guestmode` is false: the SEV probe (`identcpu.c`) is not ported, so a map only
//!   bounces for the DMA constraint (`FORCE_BOUNCE_BUFFER` is 0, as in C).
//! - A `pmap_extract` that fails in `_bus_dmamap_load_buffer` panics, as arm64's does; the C
//!   goes on with an uninitialised address.
//! - The map's size counts the segments after the header (`size_of::<BusDmamap>()` has none),
//!   where the C's `sizeof(struct bus_dmamap)` includes `dm_segs[0]` and adds
//!   `nsegments - 1`; the allocation is freed with the size it was made with.
//!   A map always has room for one segment, as the C's `dm_segs[1]` does, so `_dm_segcnt` is
//!   at least 1.
//! - Out pointers are return values (`_bus_dmamap_create`, `_bus_dmamem_alloc*`,
//!   `_bus_dmamem_map`); `_bus_dmamap_load_buffer` keeps the C's in/out state (`lastaddrp`,
//!   `segp`, `usedp`, `lastbouncep`) as `&mut` because it carries across calls.
//! - `_bus_dmamem_alloc_range` takes the pages off its local list before returning, so no
//!   page's queue entry points into a dead stack frame (the C leaves them linked).
//! - `km_alloc(kv_any, kp_none)` (bounce-page and multi-segment `bus_dmamem_map` virtual
//!   space) is reported by `uvm_km.rs` until it maps virtual-only space; those paths fail with
//!   `ENOMEM`, as the C does when `km_alloc` returns NULL. Single-segment cacheable
//!   `bus_dmamem_map` uses the direct map and works.
