//! amd64 `consinit()`: `arch/amd64/amd64/consinit.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/consinit.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. The console's receive interrupt is `com_isa`'s since M8 (`isa0 at
//! mainbus0`, `com0 at isa?`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - In C the function is empty: `init_x86_64` already ran `cninit()`, the `constab[]` probe
//!   loop of `dev/cons.c`, which picks the best of the consoles `conf.c` lists (`pc`, `com`).
//!   `constab` and `cninit` are not ported yet, so this attaches `com(4)` at `CONADDR` directly,
//!   once, with the defaults `comcnprobe`/`comcninit` would use. The machine code that reads the
//!   bootloader's console description (`comconsrate` and friends) arrives with M4.
