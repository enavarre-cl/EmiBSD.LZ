//! amd64 machine-dependent setup and shutdown: `arch/amd64/amd64/machdep.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 ports what the console and a panic need: the first part of
//! `init_x86_64` (message buffer, console, `boot -d`), `boot`, `delay` and the globals they
//! use (`cpureset_delay`, `lid_action`, `waittime`); M3 adds the direct map, `pmap_bootstrap`
//! and the memory clusters; M4 adds the descriptor tables (`setgate`, `unsetgate`,
//! `setregion`, `set_mem_segment`, `set_sys_segment`), the IDT (`idt`, `idt_allocmap`,
//! `cpu_init_idt`, `idt_vec_alloc`, `idt_vec_alloc_range`, `idt_vec_set`, `idt_vec_free`),
//! `x86_64_proc0_tss_ldt_init`, `splassert_check` and the GDT/TSS/IDT part of `init_x86_64`,
//! which now ends as the C does: `intr_default_setup`, `softintr_init`, `splraise(IPL_IPI)`,
//! `intr_enable`. `cpu_reset`,
//! `dumpsys`, the bootinfo parsing and the sysctl tree arrive with M4-b to M6; `kern_sig.c`
//! brought `sendsig`, `sys_sigreturn`, `copyoutfpu`, `initialize_thread_xstate` and
//! `signotify`. M11a adds the `MULTIPROCESSOR` parts: `cpu_kick`, `cpu_unidle`'s IPI,
//! `need_resched`'s kick, `signotify`'s `cpu_kick` and `boot`'s `X86_IPI_HALT` broadcast.
//! M13 adds ACPI to `boot` (`acpi_softc->sc_state = ACPI_STATE_S5`, `acpi_powerdown`),
//! `cpu_reset` (`cpuresetfn`, the keyboard controller's reset line, the triple fault),
//! `pwr_action`, and `bios_efiinfo->config_acpi` as `BIOS_EFIINFO_CONFIG_ACPI`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `cpu_sysctl` (M13, `machine::cpu::cpu_sysctl`) is ported with these gaps: `CPU_BIOS` is
//!   `EOPNOTSUPP` as in the C without `BAPIV_VECTOR` (Limine passes no boot arguments, so
//!   `bios_sysctl`'s `BIOS_DEV`, `BIOS_DISKINFO` and `BIOS_CKSUMLEN` cannot be reached);
//!   `CPU_FORCEUKBD` is there since pckbc(4) (M16d; it was compiled out, as in C without
//!   it); `allowaperture`
//!   is the `#else` (`APERTURE` is not configured); `cpu_sev_guestmode` (SEV probe),
//!   `amd64_has_xcrypt` (`via_nano_setup`) and `need_retpoline` (`codepatch_replace`) keep
//!   their initial values because the code that changes them is not ported.
//! - Two entries (M14): boot(8)'s, through `locore0.S` and `getbootinfo`, and Limine's. Both
//!   hand `init_x86_64` a `BootInfo`: `getbootinfo` walks `bootinfo[]` as the C does and
//!   flenses `bios_memmap[]` as the C's `init_x86_64` does into the `BootInfo` memory map
//!   (the free memory of `[IOM_END, KERNTEXTOFF)` only where boot(8) says it is free; the
//!   direct map is `locore0.S`'s 4 GB, memory above it reported, pmap_bootstrap's extension
//!   not ported), relocates the EFI memory map to `first_avail`, and lists the CPUs from the
//!   MADT (acpimadt.c is not ported). `BOOTARG_CONSDEV` sets the `com(4)` console variables
//!   but `comconsiot` (consinit attaches in I/O space). `bios_diskinfo` and `bios_memmap` are
//!   kept as their records' places in `bootinfo[]` (under Limine both are empty); `bootdev` is recorded (dkcsum.c is not ported, the root
//!   is found by the DUID). `map_tramps` and `pmap_prealloc_lowmem_ptps` run after a boot by
//!   boot(8) only.
//! - Under Limine, long mode, paging and the direct map are set up before `init_x86_64` runs, so the
//!   BIOS/EFI memory-map walk and the page-table work of the C version are replaced by the
//!   boot protocol (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Boot flow"): `pmap_direct_base` is the
//!   bootloader's higher-half direct map, and the memory clusters loaded into `uvm` are the
//!   protocol's usable regions, which already exclude the kernel, the firmware and the
//!   bootloader's own data. The ISA hole and the `avail_end` bookkeeping have nothing to do.
//! - `cpu_startup` prints the memory sizes and fills the boot CPU's TSS (`cpu_enter_pages`):
//!   `version` (generated `vers.c`, M5-b), the exec and physio maps and `bufinit` are;
//!   `cpu_init_extents` and `cpu_boot_mode` (M4-b) are not there yet.
//! - The IDT is a static page (`IDT`) instead of the early page `locore0.S` reserves and the
//!   page `init_x86_64` maps at `idt_vaddr`; `idt_allocmap` is an array of atomics.
//!   `cpu_init_msrs` and the `cpu_info_full_primary` initialiser are the first lines of
//!   `init_x86_64` because there is no `locore0.S` to run them earlier.
//!   `x86_64_proc0_tss_ldt_init` loads the task register only (from `cpu_configure`, as in
//!   C): proc0's pcb is M5. The IST
//!   stacks are filled by `cpu_enter_pages` from `cpu_startup`, as in C, so an NMI or double
//!   fault before then has no stack, as in C.
//! - The message buffer is a static area (`kern/subr_log.rs`, `init_static_msgbuf`) instead of
//!   reserved physical pages, until M3.
//! - `cninit()` is replaced by `consinit()` (`consinit.rs`): no `constab[]` yet.
//! - `delay_func` is a `StaticCell<fn(i32)>` written by `delay_init`/`delay_fini` during
//!   autoconfiguration; `delay` is the C's `DELAY(x)`/`delay(x)` macro over it.
//! - `init_x86_64` keeps the bootloader's processors (`BootInfo::mp`) in `cpu.rs`'s
//!   `BOOT_MP` (`MULTIPROCESSOR`), where the C's `acpimadt`/`mpbios` read the firmware's
//!   tables during autoconfiguration (`mainbus_attach`).
//! - `cpu_idle_cycle_fcn` and `cpu_suspend_cycle_fcn` are `StaticCell`s written while cold
//!   on the boot CPU (`cpu_init_mwait` from `cpu_attach`, `acpicpu_attach`), before any idle
//!   loop runs: the application processors wait for `CPUF_GO` until
//!   `cpu_boot_secondary_processors`, and the boot CPU does not idle during
//!   autoconfiguration (M16e; until then `cpu_idle_cycle` called `cpu_idle_cycle_hlt`).
//! - `init_x86_64` does `locore0.S`'s CPUID probe (`cpuid_level`, `cpu_vendor`, `cpu_id`,
//!   `cpu_ebxfeature`, `cpu_ecxfeature`, `cpu_feature` with `CPUID_NXE`) before
//!   `cpu_set_vendor`: there is no `locore0.S`. The meltdown and SEV probes are not there.
//! - `boot`: under feature `qemu`, the wait for a key after "The operating system has halted"
//!   is the emulator exit with the failure status, which `xtask smoke` checks after a panic.
//! - `sendsig`/`sys_sigreturn` without the FPU (`fpu.c` is not ported): `fpu_save_len` is the
//!   `fxsave` size and `cpu_use_xsaves` is false; the save area copied out is the pcb's as it
//!   is (no `fpusave`, since `CPUPF_USERXSTATE` is never set), `initialize_thread_xstate`,
//!   `fpureset`, `fpu_cleandata` and `xrstor_user` are reported. A handler therefore runs
//!   with the interrupted code's FPU/SSE registers and `sigreturn` does not restore them.
//!   `resettodr`, `if_downall`, `uvm_shutdown`, `dumpsys` and `config_suspend_all` are
//!   reported as unported when reached (`vfs_shutdown` is real since M14; with no thread on
//!   the CPU, which the C cannot have there, it is skipped).
//! - `bios_efiinfo` (boot(8)'s `BOOTARG_EFIINFO`) is replaced by Limine: its `config_acpi`,
//!   the RSDP's physical address, is `BIOS_EFIINFO_CONFIG_ACPI`, from Limine's RSDP request
//!   (`BootInfo::rsdp`), for `bios_attach`; its `config_smbios`, the SMBIOS 2 entry point,
//!   from Limine's SMBIOS request (`BootInfo::smbios`, the same `SMBIOS_TABLE_GUID` table
//!   efiboot takes). Its frame buffer fields (`fb_*`, M13: efifb(4))
//!   come from Limine's framebuffer request (`BootInfo::framebuffer`): [`bios_efiinfo`] is a
//!   `bios_efiinfo_t` with them (and `config_acpi`, `system_table`) set when the machine
//!   booted through UEFI, the C's non-NULL `bios_efiinfo`; the colour masks are the
//!   channels' sizes and shifts, the reserved mask the rest of the pixel, as efiboot copies
//!   them from the GOP mode.
//! - `KBCMDP` and `KBC_PULSE0` (`dev/ic/i8042reg.h`, not ported) and `IO_KBD`
//!   (`dev/isa/isareg.h`) are local constants of `cpu_reset`, whose last resort faults
//!   with `ud2` through the emptied IDT where the C divides by zero: either fault becomes
//!   the triple fault that resets the processor.
