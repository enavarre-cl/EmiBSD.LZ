//! amd64 `vm_machdep.c`: the machine-dependent part of creating and tearing down threads.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/vm_machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M5 (part b2) ports `cpu_fork` and `cpu_exit`; `tcb_get` and
//! `tcb_set` (`<machine/tcb.h>`'s `TCB_GET`/`TCB_SET`) come with `kern_prot.c`; M10a adds
//! physio's `kv_physwait`, `vmapbuf` and `vunmapbuf`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The TCB is a `usize` (a user address the kernel never dereferences), not a `void *`.
//! - `cpu_fork` cannot `fpusave` a parent that ran in user mode (`CPUPF_USERXSTATE`) before
//!   user mode exists (M6): the case is reported.
//! - The switch frame's `sf_r12` holds the thread function as a pointer, which
//!   `proc_trampoline_run` (`locore.rs`) turns back into a Rust `fn`: Rust function
//!   pointers have no C calling convention to `call` from assembly.
//! - `vmapbuf` panics if a user page of the request is not mapped, where the C enters the
//!   uninitialised address `pmap_extract` left (the pages are wired, so it cannot happen).
