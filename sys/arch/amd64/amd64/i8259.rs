//! The legacy 8259A interrupt controllers: `arch/amd64/amd64/i8259.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/amd64/i8259.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. `i8259_imen`, `i8259_pic`, `i8259_default_setup`, `i8259_hwmask`,
//! `i8259_hwunmask`, `i8259_reinit_irqs` and `i8259_setup`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `i8259_imen` is an `AtomicU32` exported under its C name: the interrupt stubs in
//!   `vector.S` read and write its bytes (`i8259_asm_mask`/`unmask`).
//! - `i8259_stubs` is the table `vector.S` defines; `i8259_stubs_table` returns it as a slice
//!   for `struct pic`.
//! - The add-route hook is `i8259_addroute`: it marks a level-triggered pin (`IST_LEVEL`, the
//!   PCI interrupts `pci_intr_establish` routes here) level-sensitive in the edge/level
//!   control registers (ELCR, ports 0x4d0/0x4d1) before `i8259_setup`. OpenBSD/amd64 routes
//!   PCI interrupts through the I/O APIC (`ioapic.c`, not ported) and leaves the ELCR to the
//!   firmware; QEMU's OVMF leaves every pin edge-triggered, so a PCI line two devices share
//!   (virtio-blk disks on IRQ 10/11) loses an interrupt that arrives while the other device
//!   still holds the line: no new edge, and the request never completes. i386 programs the
//!   ELCR the same way for its PCI routing (`piix_set_trigger`). TODO(M13): goes with the I/O
//!   APIC port.
