//! `disk.h` of amd64's boot programs: `struct diskinfo`, everything efiboot knows of a disk.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/stand/libsa/disk.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The disks are boxed in vectors (`disklist`, `efi_disklist` in `diskprobe.rs` and
//!   `efiboot.rs`) instead of a `TAILQ`; a box keeps its address, which `f_devdata` and
//!   `bootdev_dip` hold, as the C's list entries do.
//! - `diskio` takes the disk by reference and the buffer as a slice of `nsect` sectors.
//! - `sr_vol` (`struct sr_boot_volume *`, `SOFTRAID`) is an untyped pointer, always null:
//!   softraid is not ported (feature `softraid`).
