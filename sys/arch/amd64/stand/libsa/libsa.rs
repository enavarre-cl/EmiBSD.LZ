//! `libsa.h` of amd64's boot programs: the probe list type and what efiboot's files share;
//! and the `CPUID` macros of `<machine/specialreg.h>` they use.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/stand/libsa/libsa.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The prototypes are the definitions' own (`machdep.rs`, `memprobe.rs`, `diskprobe.rs`,
//!   `dev_i386.rs`); the BIOS-only ones (`gateA20`, `smpprobe`, `pciprobe`, `apmprobe`,
//!   `getSYSCONFaddr`, `getEBDAaddr`, `ps2model`) belong to the BIOS boot programs, which
//!   are not ported. `MACHINE_CMD` and `CHECK_SKIP_CONF` are boot(8)'s `BootMd` members.
//! - `CPUID(code, eax, ebx, ecx, edx)` returns the four registers ([`cpuid`]),
//!   `docs/C_TO_RUST.md`'s row for output-lvalue macros.
