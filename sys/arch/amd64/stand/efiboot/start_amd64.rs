/* <CODE> */
//! BOOTX64.EFI's first bytes and first instructions: the PE32+ header the firmware reads
//! and `_start`, which relocates the image and calls `efi_main` (`start_amd64.S`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/stand/efiboot/start_amd64.S @ 3ce1f3f79392 (and the PE header
//! of sys/arch/arm64/stand/efiboot/start.S @ 3ce1f3f79392)
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The PE header is written by hand in `.peheader`, as arm64's efiboot does, where amd64's
//!   is made by GNU objcopy's `efi-app-x86_64` target (llvm-objcopy has none);
//!   `ldscript.amd64` and `llvm-objcopy -O binary` finish the image (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
//!   "Boot loaders").
