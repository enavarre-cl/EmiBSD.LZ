//! efiboot's devices: `devopen()` (the first device of `devsw[]` that claims the name), the
//! boot device's name (`devboot`), and the console names (`ttyname`, `ttydev`, `cnspeed`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/stand/efiboot/dev_i386.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `SOFTRAID`'s look for a bootable softraid volume holding the boot disk is feature
//!   `softraid`, not ported: `devboot` names the disk itself (the C does too when there is no
//!   such volume).
//! - `ttyname()` returns its buffer instead of a `static` one.
