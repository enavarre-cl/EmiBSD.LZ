/* <CODE> */
//! A simple ELF relocator: apply the image's own `RELATIVE` relocations at the address the
//! firmware loaded it, before anything uses a pointer (`_start` calls it first).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/stand/efiboot/self_reloc.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Compiled for amd64 (`ELFSIZE` 64, `Elf64_Rela`, `R_X86_64_RELATIVE`). The code may use
//! nothing that needs relocating (no statics, no formatting, no panics): it runs before it is
//! done.
