//! `heap.h`: libsa's allocator gets efiboot's heap: it starts at the pages
//! `efi_heap_init` allocated and its top may not pass `HEAP_LIMIT`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/stand/efiboot/heap.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `heap_init()`, which `alloc()` calls on every call in C (`NEEDS_HEAP_INIT`) and which
//!   sets `top` the first time, is called once by `efi_heap_init`, right after the pages are
//!   allocated, and hands libsa the start and the limit (`alloc.rs`'s `heap_init`).

use core::sync::atomic::Ordering;

use crate::efiboot::{HEAP, HEAP_LIMIT};

/// `heap_init()`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `HEAP` holds the address of pages the program allocated for the heap, which nothing else
/// uses; call it once, before the first allocation.
pub unsafe fn heap_init() {
    // SAFETY: the caller's contract, which is `sa_alloc::heap_init`'s.
