//! Primitive clock interrupt routines: `arch/amd64/isa/clock.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/isa/clock.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 ports `gettick` and `i8254_delay`, the `delay(9)` the console
//! polls with before the TSC is calibrated; M5 adds the i8254 timecounter (`i8254_timecounter`,
//! `i8254_get_timecount`, `i8254_simple_get_timecount`, `i8254_inittimecounter[_simple]`),
//! `timer_mutex`, `startclocks`, `i8254_startclock`, `clockintr`, `i8254_initclocks`,
//! `i8254_start_both_clocks` and `setstatclockrate`. M8 adds the mc146818 time-of-day clock:
//! `mc146818_read/write`, `rtcget/put`, `bcdtobin/bintobcd`, `cmoscheck`, `rtc_update_century`,
//! `clock_expandyear`, `rtcgettime/settime`, `rtc_todr`, `rtcinit` (called from `cpu_startup`)
//! and `rtcalarm_suspend/resume/fired`. What is left of the RTC is its periodic interrupt
//! (`rtcintr`, `rtcdrain`, `rtcstart`, `rtcstop`), which is the statclock on the i8254 path.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The RTC's periodic interrupt is not here: `i8254_start_both_clocks` establishes IRQ0 and
//!   reports the RTC's IRQ8 statclock and `rtcstart`; `setstatclockrate` on the i8254 path
//!   reports the rate change (an RTC register write).
//! - A negative `n` in `i8254_delay` is treated as 0 (the C indexes `delaytab` with it).
//! - `mc146818_read/write` drop the `sc` argument (the C always passes NULL: "XXX softc").
//! - `rtcget` returns `Err(EINVAL)` where the C returns -1, and fills the registers in place.
//!   The century byte is the plain `NVRAM_CENTURY` where the C keeps it in the `centb` variable.
//! - `rtc_update_century` is an atomic (the C's patchable `int`); `rtc_todr` is a `static`
//!   [`TodrChipHandle`] handed to `todr_attach`.
//! - `CLOCK_DEBUG` is not configured.
//! - The `#[cfg(test)]` tests below are not compiled by `just test`: amd64's modules build
//!   only for the bare target, as for the rest of `sys/arch/amd64/`.
