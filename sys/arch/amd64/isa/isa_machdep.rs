//! amd64 ISA machine-dependent code: `arch/amd64/isa/isa_machdep.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/isa/isa_machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports the interrupt side: `isa_intr_alloc`, `isa_intr_check`,
//! `isa_intr_establish`, `isa_intr_disestablish` and `isa_attach_hook`. The ISA DMA bounce
//! buffers (`_isa_bus_dma*`, `isa_bus_dma_tag`) come with `bus_dma(9)` (M7). M13 adds the
//! `NIOAPIC > 0` pin lookup of `isa_intr_establish` (`mp_isa_bus`, set by `acpimadt`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `isa_intr_alloc` returns the IRQ as `Option` where the C returns 0/1 with an out
//!   parameter.
//! - `isa_attach_hook` takes no devices (`machine::isa_machdep` passes it none: it uses none)
//!   and sets `mainbus.rs`'s `isa_has_been_seen`, as the C.
