//! The non-volatile RAM of the PC's RTC: `arch/amd64/isa/nvram.h`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/isa/nvram.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The following information is found in the non-volatile RAM in the MC146818A (or DS1287A or
//! other compatible) RTC on AT-compatible PCs.

//! ## Deviations
//! - `NVRAM_DIAG_BITS`, the `%b` format string for the BIOS diagnostic byte, is a byte string.
//! - `MVRAM_EQUIPMENT_NFDS` keeps the C header's spelling (`MVRAM`, a typo for `NVRAM`).
