//! PCI IDE controller driver (amd64 machine-dependent portion): a compatibility-mode
//! channel's interrupt is ISA IRQ 14 (primary) or 15 (secondary), edge-triggered.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/pci/pciide_machdep.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Author: Christopher G. Demetriou, March 2, 1998 (derived from NetBSD
//! sys/dev/pci/ppb.c, revision 1.16).
//!
//! See "PCI IDE Controller Specification, Revision 1.0 3/4/94" from the PCI SIG.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The two functions are reached through `machine::pciide_machdep`
//!   (`PciideMachdep`), which `arch/amd64/mod.rs` implements with them.
