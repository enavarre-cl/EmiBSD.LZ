//! `<machine/mpbiosvar.h>`: where the application processors' real-mode trampoline lives.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/mpbiosvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `mpbios_probe`, `mpbios_intr_fixup` and `mpbios_scanned` belong to `mpbios.c` (the MP
//!   tables), which is not ported; `<machine/mpbiosreg.h>` and `<machine/mpconfig.h>` come
//!   with it.

use crate::arch::amd64::include::param::PAGE_SIZE;

/// `MP_TRAMPOLINE`: the page `mptramp.S`'s real-mode code is copied to; the STARTUP IPI's
/// vector is its page number.
pub const MP_TRAMPOLINE: usize = 16 * PAGE_SIZE;
/// `MP_TRAMP_DATA`: the page of the trampoline's data and stack.
pub const MP_TRAMP_DATA: usize = 17 * PAGE_SIZE;
