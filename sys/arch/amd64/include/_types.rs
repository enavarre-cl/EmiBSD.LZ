//! amd64 `<machine/_types.h>`: alignment rules and the `label_t` register save area.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/_types.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The exact-width, minimum-width, fast, pointer-sized and greatest-width integer typedefs,
//!   `__size_t`, `__ssize_t`, `__ptrdiff_t`, `__va_list`, the floating-point and the
//!   wide-character typedefs are Rust primitives (`i8`..`u64`, `usize`, `isize`); they are not
//!   re-declared. `__register_t` is `sys::types::Register`.
//! - `__vaddr_t`, `__paddr_t`, `__vsize_t`, `__psize_t` are the `Vaddr`/`Paddr`/`Vsize`/`Psize`
//!   newtypes in `sys::types`.
//! - `_ALIGN(p)` and `_ALIGNED_POINTER(p, t)` are the functions [`_align`] and
//!   [`_aligned_pointer`].
