//! amd64 `<machine/pic.h>`: structure common to all PIC softcs.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/pic.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports `struct pic` and the `PIC_*` types; `i8259_pic` lives in
//! `amd64/i8259.rs` and `softintr_pic` in `amd64/intr.rs`; `local_pic` (the LAPIC) and
//! `msi_pic` come with their drivers.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pic_dev` (`struct device`, autoconfiguration) is reduced to its name, `pic_name`.
//! - `pic_mutex` is `MULTIPROCESSOR` only.
//! - The stub tables live in assembly (`vector.S`), so they are reached through a function
//!   returning the slice instead of a pointer in the struct.
