//! amd64 `<machine/isa_machdep.h>`: the ISA DMA bounce-buffer cookie and its limit.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/isa_machdep.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. M16a ports what the ISA DMA tag (`isa_bus_dma_tag`, `_isa_bus_dma*` in
//! `arch/amd64/isa/isa_machdep.rs`) needs: `ISA_DMA_BOUNCE_THRESHOLD`, `struct
//! isa_dma_cookie` and its `ID_*` flags. `isa_chipset_tag_t` and the prototypes of the
//! interrupt functions are the `.c` port's and the machine contract's
//! (`machine::isa_machdep`), as M4 left them.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `atdevbase`, `ISA_PHYSADDR` and `ISA_HOLE_VADDR` are not ported: the ISA hole is the
//!   direct map's (`bus_space.rs`, `locore0.S`), and no ported driver converts hole
//!   addresses.
//! - `struct isa_dma_cookie` ends with the zero-length `id_bouncesegs[0]`: here the header
//!   is followed in the same `malloc(9)` allocation by the map's `_dm_segcnt` segments,
//!   which [`IsaDmaCookie::id_bouncesegs`] reaches (a Rust struct cannot end in an unsized
//!   array). The members the load, unload and sync functions change are `Cell`s: the map's
//!   functions reach the cookie through the shared map.
