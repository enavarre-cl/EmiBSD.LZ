//! amd64 `<machine/i82093var.h>`: the I/O APIC's software state and the encoding of an
//! interrupt handle's `line`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/i82093var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! M7b ported the `APIC_INT_*` encoding and the `APIC_IRQ_*` accessors, which
//! `pci_machdep.c` uses to tell MSI, MSI-X, I/O APIC and legacy (8259) interrupts apart;
//! M13 `struct ioapic_pin` and `struct ioapic_softc` with `ioapic.c`. The prototypes and the
//! `extern` globals (`ioapic_bsp_id`, `nioapics`, `ioapics`) are `amd64/ioapic.rs`'s.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `APIC_IRQ_*` macros are `const fn`s with lower-case names.
//! - `struct ioapic_softc` starts with its device, as the C's (whose `struct pic` starts with
//!   `pic_dev`), but `sc_pic` follows it: amd64's `struct pic` here holds a name instead of
//!   the device (`pic.rs`), and a `&str` is not valid as zeroes, so the softc
//!   `config_make_softc` zeroes holds it as `MaybeUninit`, written by `ioapic_attach`;
//!   `ioapic.rs` gets from a `&Pic` back to its softc by the field's offset. The C's
//!   `sc_pic.pic_mutex` (`MULTIPROCESSOR`) is `sc_mutex` (the ported `struct pic` has none).
//! - `sc_pins` points at the `sc_apic_sz` pins `ioapic_attach` allocates (the C's
//!   `mallocarray`); [`IoapicSoftc::pins`] returns them as a slice.
