//! amd64 `<machine/ioctl_fd.h>`: the floppy's format request, its drive types and their
//! ioctls.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/ioctl_fd.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `struct fd_formb` is what `fdformat(1)` hands `FD_FORM`; `struct fd_type` describes a
//! density (fd(4)'s `fd_types[]`), `FD_GTYPE` copies one out. Both are ABI: `repr(C)`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct fd_formb`'s `format_info` union of the structured fields and `raw[1]` is the
//!   structured member alone (`raw` is only a view of its first bytes); the
//!   `fd_formb_*` macros are its fields' names.
//! - `struct fd_type`'s `char *name` is a pointer to a NUL-terminated static string;
//!   [`FdType::name`] reads it.
//! - The `FDC_*KBPS` duplicates of `fdreg.h` are that header's constants, re-exported (the
//!   C defines them only when `fdreg.h` has not).
