//! amd64 `<machine/vmparam.h>`: the virtual address space layout.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/vmparam.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M2 needs the kernel/user boundary for `ddb`'s `INKERNEL`, M3 the
//! physical segment policy, M6 the user limits (`MAXTSIZ`, `DFLDSIZ`, `MAXDSIZ`, `BRKSIZ`,
//! `DFLSSIZ`, `MAXSSIZ`, `STACKGAP_RANDOM`, `USRSTACK`, `VM_MIN_STACK_ADDRESS`);
//! M10a (physio) `USRIOSIZE` and `VM_PHYS_SIZE`; `SHMMAXPGS` and the `VM_FREELIST_*` are
//! not there yet.
