//! amd64 `<machine/cpuvar.h>`: how a CPU is attached (`struct cpu_attach_args`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/cpuvar.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. The attach arguments, the roles and `struct cpu_functions` are here;
//! `identifycpu` and `cpu_init` (declared by the header) are `cpu.c`/`identcpu.c` and not
//! ported; `mp_cpu_funcs`, `x86_ipi` and the TSC synchronisation are `MULTIPROCESSOR`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `caa_name` is a byte string; it stays the first member (`#[repr(C)]`), which is what
//!   `mainbus_print` reads from any of mainbus's attach arguments.
