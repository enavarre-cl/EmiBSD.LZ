//! amd64 `<machine/bus.h>`: the `bus_dma(9)` types and flags.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/bus.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M7b ports the `bus_dma` half: the `BUS_DMA_*` and
//! `BUS_DMASYNC_*` flags, `bus_dma_segment_t`, `struct bus_dma_tag` (the method table the
//! `bus_dma*` macros call through) and `struct bus_dmamap`; the functions it declares
//! (`bus_dma_init`, `_bus_dmamap_*`, `_bus_dmamem_*`) are `amd64/bus_dma.rs`. The
//! `bus_space` half (the address types, `struct x86_bus_space_ops`, the `BUS_SPACE_MAP_*`
//! flags and `bus_space_barrier`) still lives in `amd64/bus_space.rs` and the machine
//! contract, where milestone M2 put it.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `bus_dma_tag_t` is `&'static BusDmaTag`; the table holds Rust `fn` pointers whose
//!   signatures return `Result` and take slices where the C passes a pointer and a count
//!   (`segs`/`nsegs`) or an out pointer (`dmamp`, `rsegs`, `kvap`). The loads are `unsafe
//!   fn`, as in the machine contract.
//! - A `bus_dmamap_t` is `&'static BusDmamap`. The C ends the map with the variable-length
//!   `dm_segs[1]` and, for bounce buffers, the page pointers after it; here the map header is
//!   followed in the same allocation by `_dm_segcnt` segments and `_dm_npages` page pointers,
//!   which [`BusDmamap::dm_segs`] and `_dm_pages` reach through pointers taken from the
//!   allocation (a Rust struct cannot end in an unsized array of `Cell`s). The members the
//!   load, unload and sync functions change after creation are `Cell`s, and so is
//!   `_dm_cookie`, which a tag's own create function sets on the map the common one made.
//! - `vaddr_t` members that hold `-1` for "none" (`_ds_va`, `_ds_bounce_va`) are `usize` with
//!   `usize::MAX`.
