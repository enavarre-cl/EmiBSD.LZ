//! amd64 `<machine/pci_machdep.h>`: machine-specific definitions for PCI autoconfiguration.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/pci_machdep.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The types amd64 provides to machine-independent PCI code (`pci_chipset_tag_t`,
//! `pcitag_t`, `pci_intr_handle_t`) and the amd64-only constants. The functions it declares
//! live in `arch/amd64/pci/pci_machdep.rs` (and `pci_bus_dma_tag` there, as in C); MI code
//! reaches them through `machine::pci_machdep`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pci_chipset_tag_t` keeps the C's `void *` as `Option<NonNull<c_void>>`; it is always NULL
//!   on amd64 (`pci_lookup_segment` returns NULL for the only segment it accepts).
//! - The `pci_intr_line(pc, ih)` macro is a function of the handle.
//! - The extent pointers (`pciio_ex`, `pcimem_ex`, `pcibus_ex`) and `pci_init_extents` wait
//!   for `sys/extent.h` (`pci_machdep.rs` reports the call).
