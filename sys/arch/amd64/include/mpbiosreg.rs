//! amd64 `<machine/mpbiosreg.h>`: the Intel MultiProcessor Specification's table formats,
//! whose interrupt-entry flags the ACPI MADT and `_PRT` reuse.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/mpbiosreg.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. M13 ports the interrupt types and flags (`MPS_INTTYPE_*`, `MPS_INTPO_*`,
//! `MPS_INTTR_*`, `MPS_INT`) and `MPS_ALL_APICS`, which `acpimadt`, `acpiprt`, `ioapic.c`
//! and `lapic.c` use. The table structures (`struct mpbios_fps`, `mpbios_cth`,
//! `mpbios_proc`, `mpbios_bus`, `mpbios_ioapic`, `mpbios_int`) and their constants come
//! with `mpbios.c`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `MPS_INT(p,t)` is a `const fn` with a lower-case name.
