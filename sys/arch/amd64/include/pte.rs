//! amd64 `<machine/pte.h>`: the MMU's page-table entries.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/pte.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The (first generation) amd64 MMU is a 4-level MMU which maps 2^48 bytes of virtual memory.
//! The pagesize we use is 4K (4096 \[0x1000\] bytes), although 2M pages are also supported.
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M3 ports the entry types, the level geometry, the PDE/PTE bits and
//! `x86_round_pdr`; the EPT bits and `PGK_VALUE` come with vmm.
