//! amd64 `<machine/tcb.h>`: the thread control block, which user space reaches through the
//! `%fs` segment base.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/tcb.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (the kernel half). `TCB_GET(p)` and `TCB_SET(p, addr)` are `tcb_get` and
//! `tcb_set`, which the header declares and `vm_machdep.c` defines (`amd64/vm_machdep.rs`);
//! `machine::Tcb` names them.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The userland half (`TLS_VARIANT`, `__amd64_read_tcb`, the userland `TCB_GET()`) is not
//!   kernel code and is not here.

/// `TCB_INVALID(addr)`: the address must be in canonical form; requiring the lower half is
/// okay.
