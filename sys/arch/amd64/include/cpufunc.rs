//! amd64 `<machine/cpufunc.h>`: access to the x86 instructions the kernel needs.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/cpufunc.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M0 ports the interrupt-flag helpers only (`read_rflags`,
//! `write_rflags`, `intr_enable`, `intr_disable`, `intr_restore`). Descriptor tables, control
//! registers, MSRs, TLB and cache helpers arrive with milestones M3 and M4; the TSC
//! timecounter adds `rdtsc`, `rdtscp` and `rdtsc_lfence`.
