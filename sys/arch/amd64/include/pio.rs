//! Programmed I/O: the x86 `in` and `out` instructions, `<machine/pio.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/pio.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Every function is `unsafe`: a port access has whatever effect the device behind the port
//! defines, and only the caller knows which device that is.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The immediate-port variants (`__inbc`, `__outbc`, ...) exist so GCC can emit the short
//!   `in al, imm8` encoding when the port is a constant below 256. rustc makes the same choice
//!   on its own, so there is one function per width.
//! - The string forms take slices instead of a pointer and a count.
