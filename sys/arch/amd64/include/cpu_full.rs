//! amd64 `<machine/cpu_full.h>`: the layout of the full per-CPU information.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/arch/amd64/include/cpu_full.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `wip`. Milestone M4 ports `struct cpu_info_full` and its layout checks; the
//! `SETUP_IST_SPECIAL_STACK` macro is inlined in `cpu_enter_pages` (`amd64/cpu.rs`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The stacks are arrays of `u64` behind `UnsafeCell`, written by `cpu_enter_pages` and the
//!   hardware; `u_align` is the `align(4096)` of the struct plus an explicit pad.
