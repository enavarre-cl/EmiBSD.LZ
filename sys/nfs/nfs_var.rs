//! `<nfs/nfs_var.h>`: the prototypes of the NFS files and two internal utility macros.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/nfs/nfs_var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The prototypes are the Rust functions in the modules of their files (`nfs_bio.rs`,
//! `nfs_boot.rs`, `nfs_node.rs`, `nfs_vnops.rs`, `nfs_serv.rs`, `nfs_socket.rs`,
//! `nfs_srvcache.rs`, `nfs_srvsubs.rs`, `nfs_subs.rs`, `nfs_syscalls.rs`, `nfs_kq.rs`), with
//! the signatures documented there; what is left here are the macros.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `mb_offset(m)` and `nfsm_padlen(s)` are functions with the C names.

use crate::nfs::nfsm_subs::nfsm_rndup;
use crate::sys::mbuf::{Mbuf, mtod};

/// `mb_offset(m)`: the address just past the data of `m` (`mtod(m, caddr_t) + m->m_len`).
pub fn mb_offset(m: &Mbuf) -> *mut u8 {
    mtod::<u8>(m).wrapping_add(m.m_len().get() as usize)
}

/// `nfsm_padlen(s)`: the XDR padding after `s` bytes.
pub const fn nfsm_padlen(s: usize) -> usize {
    nfsm_rndup(s) - s
}
