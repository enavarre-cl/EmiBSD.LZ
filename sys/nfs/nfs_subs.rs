/* <CODE> */
//! `nfs/nfs_subs.c`: the functions that support the `nfsm_subs.h` inline functions and help
//! fiddle mbuf chains for the NFS op functions: they create the RPC header, copy data between
//! mbuf chains and uio lists, load the attribute cache from a reply and map errors.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/nfs/nfs_subs.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Mbufs are `&'static Mbuf` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`). A build cursor (the C's `struct mbuf
//! **mb`, the last mbuf of the chain being built) is a `&mut &'static Mbuf`; a dissection
//! cursor is an `Option<&'static Mbuf>` with a raw position in its data, checked by
//! `nfsm_avail` (`nfsm_subs.rs`) before every use. Data comes back as the bounds-checked
//! views of `nfsm_subs.rs` ([`XdrIn`], [`XdrOut`]).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The XDR words `nfs_init` computes at startup (`rpc_call`, `nfs_true`, `nfs_xdrneg1`,
//!   ...) are `const`s computed at compile time, with their C names (lowercase:
//!   `RPC_CALL` is already the `rpcv2.h` constant).
//! - `MGET(M_WAIT)` cannot sleep here (`subr_pool.rs`): where the C cannot fail
//!   (`nfsm_reqhead`, `nfsm_build`, `nfsm_uiotombuf`) an empty pool panics, the
//!   `vfs_subr.rs` precedent; `nfsm_disct`, which returns an error anyway, fails with
//!   `ENOBUFS`.
//! - `nfsm_disct` and `nfs_adv` compute the bytes left in the current mbuf (the C's `left`
//!   argument, always that value) themselves; `nfs_adv` advances from the position when it
//!   is already far enough, a case the C's callers never reach. `nfsm_disct` returns the
//!   view instead of storing a pointer through `cp2`.
//! - [`nfsm_nextbytes`] is a Rust helper for the cursor walks of other files (`nfs_namei`
//!   copies a name byte by byte across mbufs), so that they need not dereference `dpos`.
//! - `nfsm_mbuftouio` ignores `copyout`'s error, and `nfsm_uiotombuf` `uiomove`'s, as the C
//!   does.
//! - `nfsm_buftombuf`/`nfsm_strtombuf` take a byte slice (its length is the C's `len`);
//!   `nfsm_srvfhtom` takes the `nfsfh_t` the server's handle lives in (the C passes its
//!   `fh_generic` member and reads `NFSX_V2FH` bytes from it, past the `fhandle_t`).
//! - `nfs_loadattrcache`: `option FIFO` is in GENERIC but `miscfs/fifofs` is not ported, so a
//!   new fifo node fails with `EOPNOTSUPP`, the C's `!FIFO` path (the tmpfs precedent).
//! - `nfsstats` is `NFSSTATS` of atomics (`nfs.rs`); `nfs_ticks` an `AtomicI32`.
//! - `nfs_get_xid`'s function-local statics (`nfs_xid_ctx`, `called`) are file statics, the
//!   context a `StaticCell` under a private mutex (`nfs_xid_mtx`, not in C), as
//!   `ip6_randomid` does.
//! - `nfsm_rpchead` builds `RPCAUTH_UNIX` only, as the C does (`KASSERT(auth_type ==
//!   RPCAUTH_UNIX)`); its switches over the type are the one case.
//! - `nfs_init`: under `NFSSERVER` it calls `nfsrv_init(0)` (`nfs_syscalls.c`) and
//!   `nfsrv_initcache()` (`nfs_srvcache.c`), as the C does.
//! - `nfs_vfs_init` and `nfs_getattrcache` return `Result` (`ENOENT` for a cache miss).
//! - `nfs_clearcommit`'s `goto loop` (a vnode found on the list of another mount) restarts
//!   the walk with a labelled `continue`.
//! - `nfsrv_errmap` maps an `err` below 1 to `NFSERR_IO`; the C indexes the version 2 table
//!   at `err - 1` and would read before it (its callers never pass one).
//! - `nfsm_v3attrbuild` takes `full` as a `bool`.
