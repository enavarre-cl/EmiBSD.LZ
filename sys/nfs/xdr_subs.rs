/* <CODE> */
//! `<nfs/xdr_subs.h>`: conversion to and from the XDR representation used by NFS, as defined
//! by "XDR: External Data Representation Standard" (RFC 1014).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/nfs/xdr_subs.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A raw XDR word is a `u32` as it lies in an mbuf (network byte order, read with the
//! machine's order): `fxdr_unsigned(w)` is the host value, `txdr_unsigned(v)` the raw word.
//! The C's type argument (`fxdr_unsigned(int, *tl)`) is a cast at the call site
//! (`fxdr_unsigned(tl.get(0)) as i32`); `txdr_unsigned` of a negative `int` is
//! `txdr_unsigned(x as u32)`, the same bits.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The statement macros `fxdr_nfsv2time(f, t)`, `fxdr_nfsv3time(f, t)`,
//!   `txdr_nfsv3time(f, t)`, `txdr_hyper(f, t)` are functions that return the converted
//!   value; `fxdr_hyper(f)` takes the two raw words. `txdr_nfsv2time`, declared here, is
//!   defined in `nfs_subs.rs` as in C.
//! - [`xdr_bytes`] and [`xdr_get`] are Rust helpers: the bytes of a wire structure, and a
//!   wire structure read from bytes (the C casts the pointer).
