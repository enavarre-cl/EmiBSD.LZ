/* <CODE> */
//! `<nfs/nfsdiskless.h>`: the structure that must be initialized for a diskless NFS client.
//! It is used by `nfs_mountroot()` to set up the root and swap vnodes plus do a partial
//! `ifconfig(8)` and `route(8)` so that the critical net interface can communicate with the
//! server. Whether or not the swap area is NFS mounted is determined by the value in
//! `swdevt[0]` (equal to `NODEV` means swap over NFS). Currently only works for `AF_INET`
//! protocols.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/nfs/nfsdiskless.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! NB: all fields are stored in net byte order to avoid hassles with client/server byte
//! ordering differences.
//!
//! The prototypes of `nfs_boot_init` and `nfs_boot_getfh` are the functions of
//! `nfs_boot.rs`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `ndm_args` is the `NfsArgs` of `sys/mount.rs`, whose pointer members (`addr`, `fh`,
//!   `hostname`) are `usize` addresses; `nfs_boot_getfh` points them at the members of the
//!   `NfsDlmount` it fills, as the C does, so the structure must stay where it is once
//!   `nfs_boot_getfh` has run (it is `nfs_diskless`, a static of `nfs_vfsops.c`).
//! - `sw_vp` is an `Option<&'static Vnode>`.
