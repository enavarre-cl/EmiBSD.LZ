//! The IPv6 routing header: `netinet6/route6.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet6/route6.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Routing headers of any type (type 0 is treated as unknown, RFC 5095) are skipped when no
//! segments are left, and answered with an ICMPv6 parameter problem otherwise.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The ICMPv6 pointer of the parameter problem is `off + 2` (the offset of `ip6r_type`
//!   from the start of the packet); the C computes it as the difference of two addresses
//!   (`&rh->ip6r_type - ip6`), which is the same value when the header is in the first
//!   mbuf and not meaningful when `m_pulldown` moved it.
