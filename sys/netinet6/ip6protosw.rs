//! Protocol switch table for IPv6: the argument of the IPv6 `pr_ctlinput`s:
//! `<netinet6/ip6protosw.h>`. All other definitions refer to `<sys/protosw.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet6/ip6protosw.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct ip6ctlparam` crosses `pr_ctlinput`'s `void *` (`PrCtlinputFn` in
//!   `sys/protosw.rs`), so its members are the C's raw pointers into the ICMPv6 error
//!   message being processed (valid for the call); `ip6c_m` is the mbuf reference.
