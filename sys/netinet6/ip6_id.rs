/* <CODE> */
//! Random IPv6 flow labels: `netinet6/ip6_id.c`. A linear congruential generator walks a
//! cycle modulo `ru_m`; each step is mapped through `g^x mod n` (a generator of the prime
//! `n`) and xored with a seed, so the 20-bit labels do not repeat within `ru_max` draws.
//! The top bit flips at every reseed, giving two disjoint cycles.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet6/ip6_id.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `randomtab_20` is a `StaticCell` guarded by a private mutex, `randomtab_mtx`. The C
//!   updates it without a lock (callers ran under the exclusive net lock); here
//!   `ip6_randomflowlabel` may run under the shared net lock on several CPUs.
//! - The constant part of `struct randomtab` (`ru_bits` .. `pfacts`) and its state are one
//!   struct with plain fields; the C marks the constants `const`.
