//! Multicast Listener Discovery, implementation-specific definitions: the listening states
//! and the report a membership change asks for: `<netinet6/mld6_var.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet6/mld6_var.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct mld6_pktinfo` has no `mpi_list`: the list of reports `mld6_fasttimo` collects
//!   (`struct mld6_pktlist`) is a `Vec` of them (`netinet6/mld6.rs`), as `igmp_pktinfo`'s is
//!   (`netinet/igmp_var.rs`).
//! - `MLD_RANDOM_DELAY(X)` is [`mld_random_delay`]. The prototypes are `netinet6/mld6.rs`'s.
