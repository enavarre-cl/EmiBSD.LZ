/* <CODE> */
//! IPv6 addresses and socket addresses, the `IPV6_*` socket options and the `net.inet6`
//! sysctl numbers: `<netinet6/in6.h>`; and `netinet6/in6.c`, the IPv6 addresses of the
//! interfaces (the address `ioctl`s, prefix routes, multicast records).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/netinet6/in6.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/netinet6/in6.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `in6.c` shares the module with the header, as `in.c` shares `netinet/in_.rs` with
//! `in.h`. The C header is included by `<netinet/in.h>` unconditionally, so this module is
//! compiled whether or not the `inet6` feature (OpenBSD's `option INET6`) is on.
//!
//! Byte order: as in the C kernel, an [`In6Addr`] holds the address bytes as they are on the
//! wire, and the 16- and 32-bit views (`s6_addr16`, `s6_addr32`) are the native-endian
//! readings of those bytes, so `__IPV6_ADDR_INT32_ONE` is `htonl(1)` and a comparison of
//! words is a comparison of the network-order words, as in C.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct in6_addr`'s `__u6_addr` union is the byte array `s6_addr`; `s6_addr8`,
//!   `s6_addr16` and `s6_addr32` are `const fn` accessors (and setters) reading the bytes in
//!   native order. The structure has alignment 1 (4 in C) so that it can sit in the
//!   `__packed` protocol headers; every structure holding one keeps the C size and offsets
//!   (asserted below).
//! - The address macros (`IN6_IS_ADDR_*`, `IN6_ARE_ADDR_EQUAL`, `IN6_IS_SCOPE_*`,
//!   `__IPV6_ADDR_MC_SCOPE`, `IFA6_IS_DEPRECATED`, `IFA6_IS_INVALID`) are functions of the
//!   same name in lower case, `const fn` where they read only the address.
//! - The `*_INIT` initializers and the `in6addr_*`/`in6mask*` objects (defined in `in6.c`)
//!   are `pub const` values: `IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT` and `IN6ADDR_ANY` are the same address. The
//!   kernel masks `IN6MASK0`..`IN6MASK128` stand for both the C macros and the `in6mask*`
//!   objects, and `sa6_any` is [`SA6_ANY`].
//! - `satosin6`, `satosin6_const`, `sin6tosa` and `sin6tosa_const` are pointer casts
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`); `ifatoia6` is checked, as `ifatoia` is: it takes the address
//!   family as the type tag and panics on another.
//! - `CTL_IPV6PROTO_NAMES` and `IPV6CTL_NAMES` are `Ctlname` tables.
//! - The userland part (`SIN6_LEN`, `socklen_t`, the `inet6_opt_*` and `inet6_rth_*`
//!   prototypes of libc) is not kernel material. `__KAME__` is not mirrored.
//! - The kernel prototypes are defined by the `.c` files: `ipv6_input`, `ipv6_check`,
//!   `inet6ctlerrmap` (`netinet6/ip6_input.rs`), `in6_cksum` (`netinet6/in6_cksum.rs`),
//!   `in6_proto_cksum_out` (`netinet6/ip6_output.rs`), `in6_embedscope`,
//!   `in6_recoverscope`, `in6_clearscope` (`netinet6/in6_src.rs`), `zeroin6_addr`
//!   (`netinet6/in6_pcb.rs`); `in6_addrscope`, `in6_ifawithscope`, `in6_mask2len`,
//!   `in6_nam2sin6` and `in6_sa2sin6` are this module's (`in6.c`).
//!
//! ### `in6.c`
//! - `in6_mask2len`'s limit pointer is `Option<usize>`, the number of valid mask bytes (the
//!   C's `lim0 - mask`); `None` or more than 16 is the whole address. `in6_update_ifa` passes
//!   `sin6_len - 8` as the C's pointer arithmetic does (a shorter length makes the unsigned
//!   distance huge: the whole mask).
//! - `in6_control` hands the request to `in6_ioctl` through an aligned copy when `sys_ioctl`'s
//!   buffer is not aligned for the structure (as `in_control`); the address inside a request
//!   is read and written unaligned.
//! - `in6_update_ifa` takes `&In6Aliasreq`: the C's changes of `ifra->ifra_flags` (re-run DAD)
//!   stay in a local of the function; `in6_ioctl_change_ifaddr`, which owns the request, sets
//!   `IN6_IFF_TENTATIVE` in it before the call as the C does.
//! - The `*errorp` out-parameters of `in6_addmulti` and `in6_joingroup` are the `Err`; the
//!   `malloc(M_NOWAIT)` failures are `ENOBUFS`. The membership list entries are `malloc`ed
//!   and freed by `in6_joingroup` and `in6_leavegroup`, as in the C.
//! - The two identical blocks of `in6_update_ifa` that add the route of an all-nodes group
//!   (`rtalloc`, the 32-bit key check, `rtrequest(RTM_ADD)`) are one private function,
//!   `in6_add_mcast_route`; the `goto`s of `in6_ifawithscope`'s rules are a labeled block
//!   returning a verdict (skip or replace).
//! - `in6_check_embed_scope`, `in6_clear_scope_id`, `in6_ioctl_get`,
//!   `in6_ioctl_change_ifaddr`, `in6_ifinit` and `in6_unlink_ifa` are private (file-local
//!   prototypes in C); the first two work on a copy of the request's address that is
//!   written back.
//! - `NCARP` (`carp_iamatch`, `IFT_CARP` rules in `in6_ifawithscope` and `in6if_do_dad`) and
//!   `MROUTING` (`mrt6_ioctl`) are not configured: comments at the sites.
//! - The routing code called for `AF_INET6` (`rt_ifa_add`, `rt_ifa_addlocal`, `rtalloc`,
//!   `rtrequest` of the multicast routes) is the generic code of `net/route.rs`.
