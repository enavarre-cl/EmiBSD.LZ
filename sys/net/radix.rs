/* <CODE> */
//! Radix search trees for routing lookups: `<net/radix.h>` and `net/radix.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/radix.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/net/radix.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! The data structure for the keys is a radix tree with one way branching removed. The index
//! `rn_b` at an internal node n represents a bit position to be tested. The tree is arranged so
//! that all descendants of a node n have keys whose bits all agree up to position `rn_b - 1`.
//! (We say the index of n is `rn_b`.) There is at least one descendant which has a one bit at
//! position `rn_b`, and at least one with a zero there.
//!
//! A route is determined by a pair of key and mask. We require that the bit-wise logical and
//! of the key and mask be the key. We define the index of a route associated with the mask to
//! be the first bit number in the mask where 0 occurs (with bit number 0 representing the
//! highest order bit).
//!
//! We say a mask is normal if every bit is 0 past the index of the mask. If a node n has a
//! descendant (k, m) with index(m) == index(n) == `rn_b`, and m is a normal mask, then the
//! route applies to every descendant of n. If index(m) < `rn_b`, this implies the trailing
//! last few bits of k before bit b are all 0 (and hence consequently true of every descendant
//! of n), so the route applies to all descendants of the node as well.
//!
//! Similar logic shows that a non-normal mask m such that index(m) <= index(n) could
//! potentially apply to many children of n. Thus, for each non-host route, we attach its mask
//! to a list at an internal node as high in the tree as we can go.
//!
//! The present version of the code makes use of normal routes in short-circuiting an explicit
//! mask and compare operation when testing whether a key satisfies a normal route, and also in
//! remembering the unique leaf that governs a subtree.
//!
//! Keys and masks are byte strings whose first byte is their length (a `struct sockaddr`'s
//! `sa_len`, `SALEN`). A leaf points at its caller's key, which must stay where it is while the
//! leaf is in a tree; masks are copied once into the shared mask tree (`mask_rnhead`), and a
//! leaf points at that unique copy, so masks compare by address.
//!
//! The nodes a route occupies are the caller's: `rn_addroute` takes a pair of [`RadixNode`]s
//! (`struct radix_node treenodes[2]`), usually embedded in the caller's own structure (pf's
//! `pfrke_node[2]`), and makes the first one the leaf and, unless the key is already in the
//! tree, the second one the internal node above it. `rn_delete` hands the pair back. Every
//! leaf is therefore the first element of a pair: the head's own leaves, the mask tree's
//! (`malloc`ed with their key), or a caller's.
//!
//! The tree invariant the `unsafe fn`s rely on: every node reachable from a head is live (the
//! head's, the mask tree's, which are never freed, and callers' pairs, which stay until
//! `rn_delete` returns them); an internal node (`rn_b >= 0`) has both children; every node has
//! a parent (the top's is itself); and every key a tree holds, like every key passed in, is
//! readable for its length byte's count and for the `keylen` given to [`rn_init`]. Callers
//! serialise all access to a tree (the C relies on the net lock or pf's lock).
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M9).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The `rn_u` union (leaf: `rn_key`, `rn_mask`, `rn_dupedkey`; internal node: `rn_off`,
//!   `rn_l`, `rn_r`) and `rm_rmu` (`rm_mask`, `rm_leaf`) are side-by-side fields
//!   (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`): every path reads the member its node kind (`rn_b`) or the mask's
//!   `RNF_NORMAL` selects, and `*to = *from` copies all of them. The one exception is
//!   `rn_link_dupedkey`'s branch for a parent at bit 0, which in C writes the parent's
//!   `rn_dupedkey` and so, through the union, its `rn_r`; here it writes `rn_dupedkey` only.
//!   An internal node at bit 0 needs a tree at offset 0 (only the mask tree, which never has
//!   duplicated keys) holding keys whose length bytes differ in their top bit.
//! - Links are `Cell<*const RadixNode>` / `Cell<*const RadixMask>` (NULL kept): the nodes are
//!   the callers', reached through each other and through the pair arithmetic (`&tt[1]`), so
//!   the functions that follow them are `unsafe fn`s whose contract is the tree invariant
//!   above. The public functions return `Option<&'static RadixNode>` for `struct radix_node *`
//!   (NULL is `None`); `'static` stands for "until `rn_delete` returns it", as for pool items.
//! - Keys and masks are `*const u8` (`caddr_t`/`void *`), NULL for "no mask": the tree keeps
//!   them, so they cannot be borrowed slices.
//! - `rn_walktree`'s `int (*f)(struct radix_node *, void *, u_int)` and its `void *w` are a
//!   closure `FnMut(&'static RadixNode, u32) -> Result<(), Errno>`, as `rtable_walk`'s are;
//!   the first error stops the walk and is returned.
//! - `rn_inithead(void **head, int off)` takes `&mut Option<&'static RadixNodeHead>` and
//!   returns `bool` (the C's 1 or 0); `off` is in bytes, as in C (`offsetof(struct
//!   sockaddr_in, sin_addr)`). `rn_inithead0` always returned 1 and returns nothing;
//!   `rn_initmask`'s 1 is `Err(ENOMEM)`.
//! - `rn_insert`'s `int *dupentry` is the second element of the returned tuple;
//!   `rn_add_dupedkey` and `rn_del_radix_mask` return `bool` (`false` where the C returns -1).
//!   `rn_add_dupedkey` keeps its unused `head` and `prio` arguments, `rn_delete` its unused
//!   `rn`.
//! - `rn_delete`'s `dupedkey_tt` (the start of the multipath chain) is assigned in C but never
//!   read; it is not kept. Its key comparison `memcmp(v + off, tt->rn_key + off, vlen - off)`
//!   compares nothing when `vlen <= off` (the C would pass a negative length).
//! - Only the functions `radix.h` declares are public. The other non-`static` ones of
//!   `radix.c` (`rn_refines`, `rn_addmask`, `rn_insert`, ...) and the globals `mask_rnhead`
//!   and `rtmask_pool` are private to the module; nothing else in the kernel uses them.
//! - `rn_addmask`'s on-stack `addmask_key` starts zeroed, so its trailing-zero trim never
//!   reads an uninitialised length byte.
//! - The globals are atomics (`rn_zeros`, `rn_ones`, `max_keylen`, `mask_rnhead`): they are
//!   written once by `rn_init`/`rn_initmask` before any tree exists.
