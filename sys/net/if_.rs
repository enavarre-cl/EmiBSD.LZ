/* <CODE> */
//! Network interfaces: `<net/if.h>` (what user space and the routing socket see) and
//! `net/if.c` (attaching interfaces, the index map, input and output dispatch, `ioctl`s,
//! groups, cloners and the softnet task queues).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/if.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/net/if.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `if` is a Rust keyword, so the module is `if_` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`). The kernel's own
//! `struct ifnet` is in `<net/if_var.h>`, not here; this header has the interface flags, the
//! statistics block, the routing-socket messages and the `ioctl(2)` request structures. The
//! structures cross the user/kernel boundary, so they are `#[repr(C)]` with their LP64 sizes
//! checked at compile time. The C's unnamed unions are `#[repr(C)]` unions named after their
//! member (`ifr_ifru` → [`IfrIfru`]), and the C's `#define ifr_flags ifr_ifru.ifru_flags`
//! shorthands are accessor methods (`ifr.ifr_flags()`, `ifr.set_ifr_flags(f)`).
//!
//! `if.c` keeps the interfaces on `ifnetlist` and in an index map (`if_get(index)` takes a
//! reference, `if_put` drops it); attaches them (`if_attach`: an index, a send queue
//! `if_snd` and an input queue `if_rcv` bound to a softnet task queue, the `all` group, the
//! watchdog timeout); passes received packets from the input queues to `if_input` and the
//! protocols in the softnet threads (`if_input_process`, `if_input_proto`); queues packets
//! for transmission (`if_enqueue`); runs the hooks, the interface `ioctl`s and the groups and
//! cloners; and owns `netlock` and the `netisr` word (`if_netisr`).
//!
//! Status: `if.h` `wip` (see the deviations), `if.c` `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `CTL_IFQ_NAMES` (a `struct ctlname` table) comes with `<sys/sysctl.h>`.
//! - `LINK_STATE_DESCRIPTIONS` is a slice of [`IfStatusDescription`] whose strings are byte
//!   slices; the C's terminating `{ 0, 0, NULL }` entry is the slice's end.
//! - `IFG_ALL` and `IFG_EGRESS` are byte strings without the NUL.
//! - `#include <net/if_arp.h>` is `crate::net::if_arp`, a module of its own.
//! - `if.c` shares this module with `if.h` (both are `if_` because of the keyword); the
//!   types `if.c` defines (`struct if_idxmap`, `struct softnet`) are private here.
//! - Options and pseudo-devices that are not ported are not configured, and their code is a
//!   comment at each site: `MPLS`, `MROUTING`, `NFSCLIENT`, and `NBRIDGE`, `NCARP`,
//!   `NPPP`, `NPPPOE` as 0. `INET6` (feature `inet6`: `nd6_ifattach`/`nd6_ifdetach`,
//!   `in6_ifattach`/`in6_ifdetach`, `ip6intr`, `ipv6_input`, `ns_tcp6_ml`, the `AF_INET6`
//!   cases, `::1` on the default lo(4) in `if_up`), `NETHER`, `NPF` (pf(4): the interface
//!   and group hooks of `pf_if.c`, `pf_delay_pkt`, `pf_pkt_addr_changed`) and `NBPFILTER`
//!   (bpf(4): the taps of `if_input_local`, `if_vinput` and `p2p_bpf_mtap`, `bpfdetach`)
//!   are configured.
//! - `if_up` takes a `&'static Ifnet` (the C's `struct ifnet *`): `in6_ifattach` links
//!   addresses that keep the interface.
//! - Calls into files that are not ported report themselves with `unported!` and go on as
//!   the C would with an empty subsystem: `inet_ntop` for `AF_INET` (`ifa_print_all`;
//!   `AF_INET6` prints with nd6's `In6Ntop`).
//! - `ifioctl`'s `pru_control` goes through the socket's protocol (`sys/protosw.rs`), as in
//!   C; the kernel's own requests come with a NULL socket and go to `in_ioctl` as privileged
//!   ones (the boot self-test configures an interface that way).
//! - `ifioctl`'s `struct socket *` is a raw pointer (NULL for the kernel's own requests) and
//!   `caddr_t data` a raw pointer: `ifioctl` and the `ioctl` helpers are `unsafe fn`s whose contract is
//!   `sys_ioctl`'s kernel copy of the argument. `SIOCSIFXFLAGS`'s `goto forceup` into the
//!   `SIOCSIFFLAGS` case is a flag checked after the `match`.
//! - The index map is SMR-protected as in C (M11d): a grown map is freed by `smr_call`
//!   through `struct if_idxmap_dtor` in the old bitmap, `if_idxmap_remove` waits with
//!   `smr_barrier`. Its locked part is `if_idxmap_unlink`, so the host tests (no SMR thread)
//!   can check it.
//! - `if_attach` and `if_attachhead` panic on an interface that already has an index (the C
//!   would corrupt `ifnetlist`); `if_start`'s `KASSERT(if_qstart == if_qstart_compat)` checks
//!   `IFXF_MPSAFE` instead (function pointers do not compare reliably in Rust).
//! - `counters_inc`/`counters_pkt` (`<sys/percpu.h>`) are here, over `if_var.rs`'s
//!   [`IfCounterArray`]; `if_counters_alloc` allocates it with `malloc(M_COUNTERS)`.
//! - Without `MULTIPROCESSOR` `NET_TASKQ` is 1 and `softnet_percpu` has nothing to do. With
//!   it (M11d) `softnet_init` makes eight softnet queues and `softnet_percpu` destroys those
//!   past `softnet_count()`, one per CPU; the `KERNEL_LOCK()`/`KERNEL_UNLOCK()` pairs and
//!   `KERNEL_ASSERT_LOCKED()` are real (`sys/systm.rs`; nothing without `MULTIPROCESSOR`).
//!   Since M11e the softnet threads run without the kernel lock (`TASKQ_MPSAFE`), under the
//!   net lock as in C: `if_input_process` shared, `if_netisr` exclusive.
//! - `malloc(M_WAITOK)` that fails panics where the C would sleep (the index map,
//!   `if_alloc_sadl`, `if_attach_queues`, `if_counters_alloc`; `malloc(9)` does not sleep yet).
//! - The hook lists (`if_*hook_add`) and `if_clone_attach`, `ifa_add` are `unsafe fn`s: they
//!   link a caller's object that must stay valid while linked. Out parameters are return
//!   values (`if_clone_lookup` returns the unit with the cloner); `int` results that are
//!   errors are `Result<(), Errno>`, booleans `bool` (`if_isconnected`, `if_congested`,
//!   `niq_enqueue`'s "dropped").
