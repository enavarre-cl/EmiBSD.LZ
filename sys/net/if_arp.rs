//! Address Resolution Protocol: `<net/if_arp.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/if_arp.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! See RFC 826 for protocol description. ARP packets are variable in size; the `arphdr`
//! structure defines the fixed-length portion. Protocol type values are the same as those for
//! 10 Mb/s Ethernet. It is followed by the variable-sized fields `ar_sha`, `ar_spa`, `ar_tha`
//! and `ar_tpa` in that order, according to the lengths specified. Field names used
//! correspond to RFC 826. The fields are in network order on the wire; the constants are
//! host-order values to compare after `ntohs`.
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The variable-sized fields exist only in a `COMMENT_ONLY` block in the C; there is nothing
//!   to port. `struct ether_arp` (`netinet/if_ether.rs`) is the Ethernet/IPv4 layout.
