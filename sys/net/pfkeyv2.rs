/* <CODE> */
//! `PF_KEY` version 2 (RFC 2367 with OpenBSD's extensions): `<net/pfkeyv2.h>` (the message
//! and extension structures, the constants) and `net/pfkeyv2.c` (the `pfkeydomain` socket
//! domain, the message handler `pfkeyv2_dosend` that adds, updates, deletes and dumps SAs and
//! flows, and the messages the kernel sends on its own: `SADB_ACQUIRE`, `SADB_EXPIRE`).
//! `ipsecctl(8)` and `isakmpd(8)` talk to the kernel through it.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/pfkeyv2.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/net/pfkeyv2.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A message is a `struct sadb_msg` followed by extensions, each a multiple of 8 bytes whose
//! first two fields are its length (in 8-byte units) and type. The handler and the export
//! functions keep the C's `void *headers[SADB_EXT_MAX + 1]`: a pointer per extension type
//! into the message or into buffers the kernel builds, NULL when absent.
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M9c).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The ABI structures are `#[repr(C)]` with the C's layout (pinned below); they are read
//!   and written in message buffers with unaligned copies ([`sadb_get`], [`sadb_put`]), so a
//!   message needs no alignment.
//! - `void *headers[]` is [`SadbHeaders`], raw pointers; the functions that read or write
//!   through them (and the `void **p` cursors of the exports) are `unsafe fn`s whose
//!   contract is the C's: every non-NULL header points at a whole extension, and a cursor at
//!   enough room.
//! - The message buffers (`malloc(M_PFKEY)` in C) are `Vec<u8>`s allocated with
//!   `try_reserve` (the C's `M_NOWAIT` failure is the same `ENOMEM`) and wiped before they
//!   are dropped where the C wipes them. The temporary TDB of `SADB_GETSPI` (`malloc(M_ZERO)`)
//!   is a local `Tdb`.
//! - `union sockaddr_union *` pointers into a message become [`SockaddrUnion`] copies of the
//!   address's `sa_len` bytes (the C's `bcopy` of the whole union may read past a 16-byte
//!   `sockaddr_in`; the bytes after `sa_len` are never compared).
//! - `struct pkpcb` is a `pkpcb_pool` item reached from `so_pcb`; `pkptable`'s list is a
//!   `TailqHead` under its rwlock; `pfkeyv2_seq`, `nregistered` and `npromisc` are atomics
//!   changed under `pfkeyv2_mtx`, as in C.
//! - The walkers' `void *` state (`struct dump_state`, `struct pfkeyv2_sysctl_walk`, the
//!   satype of `pfkeyv2_sa_flush`) is what the closures given to `tdb_walk` and
//!   `spd_table_walk` capture; `w_where` is a user address.
//! - `pfkeyv2_sysctl` follows `pr_sysctl`'s calling convention; the process it checks and
//!   whose routing table it uses is `curproc`, as in C.
//! - `NPF` (pf(4)) is configured: the `SADB_X_EXT_TAG`/`TAP` extensions.
//! - `INET6` is configured (feature `inet6`): the `SENT_IP6` flows and `AF_INET6` addresses
//!   of `pfkeyv2_policy`, `pfkeyv2_get` and `pfkeyv2_dump_policy`. Not configured, each a
//!   comment at its site: `IPSEC` and `TCP_SIGNATURE`
//!   (`SADB_X_SATYPE_TCPSIGNATURE`, `XF_TCPSIGNATURE`; M9+) are.
