//! `<net/if_media.h>` and `net/if_media.c`: network interface media selection, BSD/OS
//! compatible. The media words (`IFM_*`), `struct ifmedia` (the list of media a driver
//! supports and the one selected) and the functions drivers call to fill it and to answer
//! `SIOCGIFMEDIA`/`SIOCSIFMEDIA`, plus `ifmedia_baudrate`, the interface speed of a media word.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/if_media.h @ 3ce1f3f79392, sys/net/if_media.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The description tables (`struct ifmedia_description`, `IFM_TYPE_DESCRIPTIONS`,
//!   `IFM_SUBTYPE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `IFM_MODE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `IFM_OPTION_DESCRIPTIONS`,
//!   `struct ifmedia_status_description`, `IFM_STATUS_DESC`, `IFM_STATUS_DESCRIPTIONS`,
//!   `IFM_STATUS_VALID_LIST`) are left out: ifconfig(8) builds them from the C header, and the
//!   kernel reads them only under `IFMEDIA_DEBUG`, which is not defined (so `ifmedia_debug`
//!   and `ifmedia_printword` are left out as well).
//! - `struct ifmedia` is made of `Cell`s, so a zeroed softc holds a valid one; the callbacks
//!   are `Option<fn>`s, `None` until `ifmedia_init`. `ifm_cur`, `ifm_list` and `ifm_nwords`
//!   change only under `ifmedia_mtx`, as in C; `ifm_mask` and `ifm_media` as in C too (the
//!   attach and `ifmedia_ioctl`). The entries are `malloc`ed and freed only by
//!   `ifmedia_delete_instance`, which clears `ifm_cur` under the mutex.
//! - `ifmedia_ioctl` is an `unsafe fn` that takes the ioctl's `data` (a `struct ifreq` for
//!   `SIOCSIFMEDIA`, a `struct ifmediareq` for `SIOCGIFMEDIA`), with `sys_ioctl`'s contract,
//!   as a driver's `if_ioctl` does; the C's `NULL` checks of its pointers become a null
//!   check of `data`. `ifmedia_add`'s `int data` is stored as `u_int`, as in C.
//! - `ifmedia_get`'s "multiple match" message is printed under feature `diagnostic`
//!   (`DIAGNOSTIC`; `IFMEDIA_DEBUG` is not defined).
//! - Functions returning 0 or an errno return `Result<(), Errno>`; `ifmedia_match` returns
//!   `bool`. `IFM_TYPE`, `IFM_SUBTYPE`, `IFM_INST`, `IFM_OPTIONS`, `IFM_MODE`,
//!   `IFM_MAKEWORD` and `IFM_TYPE_MATCH` are `const fn`s with lower-case names.
