//! The Allotment Routing Table (ART): `<net/art.h>` and `net/art.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/art.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/net/art.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Yoichi Hariguchi's paper can be found at <http://www.hariguchi.org/art/art.pdf>. This
//! implementation is tweaked to minimise pointer traversal during lookups by only accessing
//! the heaps; it avoids following pointers to or through the [`ArtTable`] structures.
//!
//! A heap is an array of [`ArtHeapEntry`] words whose meaning depends on where they are. Most
//! entries point at nodes ([`ArtNode`], leaf entries) or at the next heap to traverse; the two
//! kinds are tagged by the low bit (a heap pointer has it set) and masked before use. The first
//! two entries are not used by the search: `heap[0]` points at the [`ArtTable`] of this part of
//! the tree, and `heap[1]` holds the node that would be in the parent heap if this table were
//! not using its slot, the default entry (route) of the table. Nodes hold the exact prefix they
//! represent (address and prefix length) and a pointer to the data associated with it
//! (`an_value`):
//!
//! ```text
//!   struct art --art_root--> heap --heap[0]--> struct art_table --at_parent--> NULL
//!                             |   <--at_heap--
//!                             | heap entry
//!                             v
//!                            heap --heap[0]--> struct art_table --at_parent--> (above)
//!                             | node entry
//!                             v
//!                     struct art_node --an_value--> "user" data
//! ```
//!
//! Locking: modification (`art_insert`, `art_delete`) and iteration (`art_iter_next`, ...)
//! over the ART must be serialised by the caller. Lookups (`art_match`, `art_lookup`) run
//! within an SMR critical section in C. Iteration manipulates the reference counts of the
//! tables it traverses and keeps them until it runs out of entries, so a caller may release its
//! locks between `art_iter_open` and `art_iter_next`; `art_iter_close` drops them early. The
//! iterator holds no reference on the nodes or on the data hanging off `an_value`.
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - SMR as in C (M11e): the heap words are [`ArtHeapWord`]s, `art_root` and `an_value` are
//!   [`SmrPtr`]s; their `get` is `SMR_PTR_GET` (an `Acquire` load, which the writer's locked
//!   reads also use) and `set` `SMR_PTR_SET_LOCKED` (a `Release` store). The lookups assert
//!   the read section and the garbage collectors wait with `smr_barrier` before they free.
//! - A heap is reached through a raw pointer to its first word (`*const ArtHeapWord`): its
//!   size is `1 << (bits + 1)` words, which only its table knows, and the lookups do not read
//!   the table (the C's point). The slot accessor is `unsafe` with that bound as its contract;
//!   every index comes from [`art_bindex`], which stays below the size by construction.
//! - The `an__u` union (`an_gc` for the garbage collector, `an_addr` for the prefix) is two
//!   fields side by side (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`): the collector's link is written after the
//!   node left the tree, when nothing reads the address any more.
//! - `struct art`'s `art_levels` is a slice (`art_nlevels` is kept beside it, as in C);
//!   `art_alloc` writes an initialised `Art` into the `malloc`ed block instead of relying on
//!   `M_ZERO`, because an empty slice is not all-zero bits.
//! - Addresses are byte slices (`&[u8]`) holding at least the address length's bytes; the C
//!   takes `const void *` into a socket address.
//! - `art_allot`, which the C writes as Knuth's `goto` expansion of a double recursion,
//!   is the recursion: depth is at most a table's stride (8). It descends into a non-fringe
//!   slot only when the slot holds the replaced entry, as the expansion does.
//! - `art_table_get`'s `j == -1` for the root is `u32::MAX` (the C's `unsigned int` -1).
