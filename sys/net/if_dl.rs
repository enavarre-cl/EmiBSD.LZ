/* <CODE> */
//! The link-level socket address: `<net/if_dl.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/if_dl.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A link-level sockaddr may specify the interface in one of two ways: by a system-provided
//! index number (computed anew and possibly differently on every reboot), or by a
//! human-readable string such as "il0" (for managerial convenience). Census taking actions,
//! such as something akin to `SIOCGCONF`, would return both the index and the human name.
//! High volume transactions (such as giving a link-level "from" address in a recvfrom or
//! recvmsg call) may be likely only to provide the indexed form, which requires fewer copy
//! operations and less space. The form and interpretation of the link-level address is purely
//! a matter of convention between the device driver and its consumers; however, all drivers
//! for an interface of a given `if_type` are expected to agree.
//!
//! Status: `ported`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `LLADDR(s)` is the `unsafe fn` [`lladdr`] over a raw pointer: a `sockaddr_dl` may be
//!   longer than the structure (`if_alloc_sadl` allocates room for the name and the address),
//!   so the result can point past the 24 bytes a reference would cover.
//! - `satosdl`, `satosdl_const` and `sdltosa` are pointer casts (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
//! - `link_ntoa(3)` is userland.
