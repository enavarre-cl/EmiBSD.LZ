//! Network software interrupt bits: `<net/netisr.h>`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/netisr.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Each "pup-level-1" input queue has a bit in a "netisr" status word which is used to
//! de-multiplex a single software interrupt used for scheduling the network code to calls on
//! the lowest level routine of each protocol. The constants are bit numbers.
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `netisr` (the status word) and `if_input_task_locked` are defined in `net/if_.rs`, where
//!   `net/if.c` defines them, and re-exported here; `schednetisr(anisr)` is a function. The
//!   `*intr()` prototypes come with their `.c` files (`arpintr`, `ipintr` are not ported).
//! - `schednetisr` before `softnet_init` (no softnet task queue yet) sets the bit only; the C
//!   would dereference the NULL queue.
