/* <CODE> */
//! Routing tables and the routing socket's messages: `<net/route.h>` and `net/route.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/net/route.h @ 3ce1f3f79392
//! Upstream: sys/net/route.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Kernel resident routing tables. The routing tables are initialized when interface addresses
//! are set by making entries for all directly connected interfaces. Routes to hosts are
//! distinguished from routes to networks, preferring the former if available; for each route
//! the interface to use is inferred from the gateway address supplied when the route was
//! entered. Routes that forward packets through gateways are marked with `RTF_GATEWAY` so that
//! the output routines know to address the gateway rather than the ultimate destination. With
//! `RTF_GATEWAY` set, `rt_gwroute` points at the `rtentry` of the gateway (the next hop's
//! link-layer route); without it, `rt_cachecnt` counts the `RTF_GATEWAY` entries whose
//! `rt_gwroute` points here.
//!
//! The constants take the type of the field that stores them: `RTF_*` are `u32` (`rt_flags`),
//! `RTM_*` message types `u8` (`rtm_type`), `RTA_*` `i32` (`rtm_addrs`), `RTAX_*` `usize`
//! (indices into `rti_info`), `RTP_*` `u8` (`rt_priority`), `RTV_*` `u32` (`rtm_inits`).
//!
//! The locks named in the field docs are the C's: \[I\] immutable after creation, \[N\] net
//! lock, \[X\] exclusive net lock (or shared net lock and kernel lock), \[R\] the rtable lock,
//! \[r\] the route's `rt_mtx`, \[L\] the ARP/ND lock for updates, net lock for reads, \[T\]
//! `rttimer_mtx`, \[a\] atomic operations.
//!
//! Status: `route.h` `wip` (`struct route`'s IPv6 members, see below), `route.c` `ported`
//! (M7b). The licence block carries the NRL notice with its advertising clause, accepted as
//! BSD-4 (`.claude/rules/scope-and-stubs.md`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct rtentry` is shared through `&'static Rtentry`, as `struct rtentry *` is: a route
//!   is a pool item that lives until its last `rtfree` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`, reference-counted
//!   pool objects). Its members are `Cell`s and atomics (the C changes them through the
//!   pointer under the locks above), so the all-zero value `PR_ZERO` gives is valid. The
//!   `rt_use`, `rt_expire`, `rt_locks` and `rt_mtu` shorthands are methods returning the
//!   metric's cell; `rt->rt_ifa`, which the C dereferences without a check, is
//!   [`Rtentry::ifa`], which panics on a route without an address (one `rtrequest` did not
//!   make).
//! - `struct rt_kmetrics` (kernel only) holds cells and `rmx_mtu` is an `AtomicU32` (the C's
//!   `[a]`); `rt->rt_rmx = parent->rt_rmx` is [`RtKmetrics::assign`].
//! - `struct route` has `Cell` members so a cache inside a shared structure (`struct
//!   netstack`'s `ns_route`) can be refreshed through `&`; its unions are `#[repr(C)]` unions
//!   with accessors (`ro_dstsin6` is a `SockaddrIn6`, `ro_srcin6` an `In6Addr`).
//!   `route6_cache` and `route6_mpath` (the C's `#ifdef INET6`) always compile, as netinet6 does, so the tree builds without the `inet6` feature. A mask buffer (`struct
//!   sockaddr_in6 sa_mask` in C, big enough for any family) is a `sockaddr_storage`.
//! - `struct rt_addrinfo`'s `rti_flags` is a `u32` (`int` in C), the type of the `RTF_*`
//!   values it carries; `rti_info[]` holds raw socket addresses, so the functions that read
//!   them (`rtrequest`, `rt_ifa_add`, `rtalloc`, ...) are `unsafe fn`s whose contract is that
//!   every non-NULL address is readable for its `sa_len` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
//! - `struct rttimer` (private to `route.c` in C) is here with the queue it links to, because
//!   `struct rtentry`'s `rt_timer` list names it; its queue functions keep the C's names.
//! - Out parameters: `struct rtentry **ret_nrt` is `Option<&mut Option<&'static Rtentry>>`
//!   (`RTM_RESOLVE` reads the cloning route from it); `rt_copysa` returns the copy; errors are
//!   `Result<(), Errno>` (`route_cache`'s "miss" is `Err(ESRCH)`, as its `int` is).
//!   `rt_hash`'s -1 is `None`.
//! - `rtcounters` (`struct cpumem *`, `<sys/percpu.h>` not ported) is one static array of
//!   atomics, as `uvmexp` and `mbstat` are; `rtstat_inc` bumps it.
//! - `MPLS` and `BFD` are not configured: `rt_mpls_set`/`rt_mpls_clear`, `bfdinit` and
//!   `bfdclear` are comments at their sites.
//! - `KERNEL_LOCK()`/`KERNEL_UNLOCK()` are the kernel lock's functions (`sys/systm.rs`; real
//!   with `MULTIPROCESSOR`, nothing without); `membar_producer()` before bumping
//!   `rtgeneration` is a release fence.
//! - `rt_next`, which the C reads with `SMR_PTR_GET` inside SMR read sections and writes with
//!   `SMR_PTR_SET_LOCKED` under the rtable lock, is an [`RtNext`] (an [`SmrPtr`]). The other
//!   members stay `Cell`s read and written as the C does under the locks above; the C reads
//!   some of them (`rt_flags`, `rt_priority`, `rt_gateway`) unlocked from the softnet
//!   threads, and so does the port.
//! - The routing socket side (`rtm_send`, `rtm_miss`, `rtm_addr`, ...) is `net/rtsock.rs`;
//!   `rtlabel_id2name` fills a caller's byte buffer and returns the name's slice.
//! - `ifafree` frees the address with `free(ifa, M_IFADDR, 0)`, as the C does, so an address
//!   that reaches it was `malloc`ed by its protocol.
