//! tmpfs vnode interface for special devices: the operations of a block or character
//! device node stored in a tmpfs file system (`tmpfs_specvops`), which keep the node's
//! times and leave the device work to `spec_vnops`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/tmpfs/tmpfs_specops.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - The helpers the C installs in many slots (`vop_generic_badop`) are closures, as in
//!   `spec_vops` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
