/* <CODE> */
//! Generic routines to convert between a POSIX date (seconds since 1/1/1970) and
//! yr/mo/day/hr/min/sec: `kern/clock_subr.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/clock_subr.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported`. `clock_ymdhms_to_secs` and `clock_secs_to_ymdhms`, with `leapyear` and the
//! month table. `struct clock_ymdhms`, `FROMBCD`/`TOBCD`, `SECDAY` and `POSIX_BASE_YEAR` are
//! `<sys/time.h>`'s (`sys/time.rs`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `clock_secs_to_ymdhms` returns the broken-down time instead of filling an out parameter.
//! - The day count and the seconds sum are `i64`, where the C uses `int` for the days (and for
//!   `((days * 24 + hour) * 60 + min)`, which overflows past the year 6000).
//! - A month above 12 in `clock_ymdhms_to_secs` adds no days for the months past December; the
//!   C reads past the end of `month_days[]`.
//! - The C copies `month_days[]` to a local so as to make February 29 days in a leap year;
//!   here the leap day is added to the month's length when it is looked up.
