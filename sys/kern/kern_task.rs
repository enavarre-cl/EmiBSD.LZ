//! Task queues: `kern/kern_task.c`, see `task_add(9)` and `taskq_create(9)`. A task queue
//! owns one or more kernel threads that run the tasks queued on it, in order, in process
//! context. `systq` (under the kernel lock) and `systqmp` (`TASKQ_MPSAFE`) exist from boot.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/kern_task.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M7b): `taskq_init`, `taskq_create`, `taskq_destroy`,
//! `taskq_create_thread`, `taskq_barrier_task`, `taskq_do_barrier`, `taskq_barrier`,
//! `taskq_del_barrier`, `task_set`, `task_add`, `task_del`, `taskq_next_work`, `taskq_thread`.
//! M11e: a `TASKQ_MPSAFE` queue's workers drop the kernel lock their kthread starts with
//! around their loop, as in C, so `systqmp`'s tasks run without it.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `WITNESS` is not configured: `taskq_lock_type`, `TASKQ_LOCK_FLAGS`, `tq_lock_object` and
//!   the `WITNESS_INIT`/`WITNESS_CHECKORDER`/`WITNESS_LOCK`/`WITNESS_UNLOCK` calls are absent.
//! - `kcov` is not configured: `task_add` does not record `t_process` and `taskq_thread` has
//!   no `kcov_remote_enter`/`kcov_remote_leave`.
//! - `task_add_local` is `task_add` for a task that is not `'static` (an `unsafe fn`): what
//!   `sched_barrier` queues from its stack frame.
//! - `struct taskq` is `#[repr(C)]` with `tq_state` first so that the queue's own address (the
//!   "bored" and destroy wakeup channel) never equals `&tq_running`, `&tq_bthreads` or
//!   `&tq_bgen`, the other channels, as in C.
//! - `taskq_create` returns `Option<&'static Taskq>` and `taskq_destroy` takes the
//!   `NonNull<Taskq>` back and is `unsafe` (it frees); `task_add` takes a `&'static Task`,
//!   since a pending task must outlive its place on the worklist (`task_add(9)`).
//! - `task_add`, `task_del` and `taskq_next_work` return `bool` for the C's `0`/`1`;
//!   `taskq_next_work` returns the copy of the task (`*work = *next`) instead of filling an
//!   out parameter.
//! - A task without a function (a `Task::zeroed` that `task_set` never saw) panics in
//!   `taskq_thread`, where the C would call through a null pointer.
