/* <CODE> */
//! The buffer cache: `bread`/`bwrite` and their friends over the per-vnode buffers, the
//! cleaner thread (`buf_daemon`) that writes delayed buffers out, and the 2Q cache of clean
//! buffers (hot, warm and cold queues) that decides which ones to throw away.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/vfs_bio.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Some references:
//! - Bach: The Design of the UNIX Operating System (Prentice Hall, 1986)
//! - Leffler, et al.: The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System
//!   (Addison Welley, 1989)
//!
//! ## How a file system uses it
//! - `let (bp, error) = bread(vp, lblkno, size)`: the buffer comes back busy in both cases,
//!   as the C's `*bpp` does; on error the caller `brelse`s it.
//! - `getblk(vp, lblkno, size, 0, INFSLP)` for a block it will overwrite; `bwrite`,
//!   `bawrite` or `bdwrite` to write it (they release it), `brelse` to give it back unchanged.
//! - The file system's `VOP_STRATEGY` maps `b_lblkno` to `b_blkno` (`VOP_BMAP`) and hands
//!   the buffer to its device vnode's `VOP_STRATEGY` (`spec_strategy`), whose driver calls
//!   `biodone` when the transfer is over.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `bread`, `breadn` and `bread_cluster` return the buffer with the result, `(bp,
//!   Result<(), Errno>)`, instead of filling `*bpp`: the C always fills it.
//! - `bcstats` is [`BCSTATS`], `struct bcachestats` as atomics with a `snapshot()` for
//!   `vfs.generic.bcachestat` (as `nchstats`); the tunables (`lodirtypages`, `targetpages`,
//!   ...) are atomics, `bufhead`, `cleancache` and `dirtyqueue` `Sync` statics changed at
//!   `splbio`.
//! - `getblk` and `buf_get` return `Option` (the C's NULL); `incore` likewise.
//! - The cleaner's `TRACEPOINT`s (`dt(4)`) are not configured, nor is `HIBERNATE`
//!   (`hibernate_suspend_bufcache`); the DDB printer `bcstats_print` waits for the ddb
//!   command loop (`db_command.c`).
//! - `curproc->p_ru.ru_inblock++`/`ru_oublock++` are skipped when there is no `curproc`
//!   (the C always has one).
//! - `pool_get(PR_WAITOK)` and `uvm_pagealloc_multi(UVM_PLA_WAITOK)` cannot sleep yet
//!   (`subr_pool.rs`, `uvm_pdaemon.rs`): `buf_get` returns NULL when the pool fails, which
//!   `getblk` retries as the C does after a sleep, and `buf_alloc_pages` panics as the C does
//!   when even the waiting allocation fails.

// bufcache freelist code below
//
// The code below implements a variant of the 2Q buffer cache algorithm by Johnson and Shasha.
//
// General Outline
// We divide the buffer cache into three working sets: current, previous, and long term. Each
// list is itself LRU and buffers get promoted and moved around between them. A buffer starts
// its life in the current working set. As time passes and newer buffers push it out, it will
// turn into the previous working set and is subject to recycling. But if it's accessed again
// from the previous working set, that's an indication that it's actually in the long term
// working set, so we promote it there. The separation of current and previous working sets
// prevents us from promoting a buffer that's only temporarily hot to the long term cache.
//
// The objective is to provide scan resistance by making the long term working set ineligible
// for immediate recycling, even as the current working set is rapidly turned over.
//
// Implementation
// The code below identifies the current, previous, and long term sets as hotqueue, coldqueue,
// and warmqueue. The hot and warm queues are capped at 1/3 of the total clean pages, after
// which point they start pushing their oldest buffers into coldqueue.
// A buf always starts out with neither WARM or COLD flags set (implying HOT). When released,
// it will be returned to the tail of the hotqueue list. When the hotqueue gets too large, the
// oldest hot buf will be moved to the coldqueue, with the B_COLD flag set. When a cold buf is
// released, we set the B_WARM flag and put it onto the warmqueue. Warm bufs are also directly
// returned to the end of the warmqueue. As with the hotqueue, when the warmqueue grows too
// large, B_WARM bufs are moved onto the coldqueue.
//
// Note that this design does still support large working sets, greater than the cap of
// hotqueue or warmqueue would imply. The coldqueue is still cached and has no maximum length.
// The hot and warm queues form a Y feeding into the coldqueue. Moving bufs between queues is
// constant time, so this design decays to one long warm->cold queue.
//
// In the 2Q paper, hotqueue and coldqueue are A1in and A1out. The warmqueue is Am. We always
// cache pages, as opposed to pointers to pages for A1.
//
// This implementation adds support for multiple 2q caches.
//
// If we have more than one 2q cache, as bufs fall off the cold queue for recycling, bufs that
// have been warm before (which retain the B_WARM flag in addition to B_COLD) can be put into
// the hot queue of a second level 2Q cache. buffers which are only B_COLD are recycled. Bufs
// falling off the last cache's cold queue are always recycled.
