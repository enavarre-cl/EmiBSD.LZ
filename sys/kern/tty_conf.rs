//! The line discipline switch: `kern/tty_conf.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/tty_conf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `pseudo-device ppp`, `nmea`, `msts` and `endrun` are not configured (their line
//!   disciplines are not ported), so slots 5, 7, 8 and 9 hold the defunct entries the C
//!   uses when `NPPP`, `NNMEA`, `NMSTS` or `NENDRUN` is 0.
//! - `ttynodisc`, `ttyerrclose`, `ttyerrio`, `ttyerrinput` and `ttyerrstart` are the C's
//!   casts of `enodev`: small functions of each type here. `l_rint` and `l_start` return the
//!   errno as an `int`, as the cast does.
//! - `nullioctl` returns `Ok(false)` for the C's `-1` (`docs/C_TO_RUST.md`).
