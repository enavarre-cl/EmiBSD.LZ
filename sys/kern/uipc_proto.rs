//! Definitions of protocols supported in the UNIX domain: `kern/uipc_proto.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/uipc_proto.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! `unixsw[]` holds the three local socket types (stream, sequenced packet and datagram),
//! all of them passing rights (`PR_RIGHTS`); `unixdomain` is `AF_UNIX`, initialised by
//! `unp_init` and externalizing and disposing of rights with `unp_externalize` and
//! `unp_dispose` (`uipc_usrreq.rs`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `dom_protoswNPROTOSW` is the end of the `dom_protosw` slice (`sys/domain.rs`).
