/* <CODE> */
//! Advisory record locking (`fcntl(2)`'s `F_SETLK`/`F_GETLK` and `flock(2)`): the byte-range
//! locks of one file, kept sorted by start in a `struct lockf_state` the file's vnode (or
//! inode) points at, with the blocked requests queued on the lock that blocks them.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/vfs_lockf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A `struct lockf` and a `struct lockf_state` are pool items, so they travel as
//! `&'static Lockf`/`&'static LockfState`, with `Cell` members guarded by `lockf_lock`, as
//! `struct mbuf` and `struct file` do; `lf_free` and `ls_rele` hand the item back to its pool,
//! after which the caller does not touch it, as in C.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `struct lockf_state **state` is `&LockfStateSlot` (a `Cell<Option<&'static
//!   LockfState>>`) and `ls_owner` keeps it as a raw pointer to the slot, which lives in the
//!   vnode's `specinfo` (or a file system's inode) until `lf_purgelocks` empties it.
//! - `lf_findoverlap` returns the case and the overlap as a pair instead of filling
//!   `**overlap`; `lf_getblock` returns `Option`, `lf_deadlock` a `bool`.
//! - `lf_flags` is an `i32` (the C's `short`) since the `F_*` flags it holds are `i32`s.
//! - `pool_get(PR_WAITOK)` cannot sleep yet (`subr_pool.rs`): when it fails `lf_alloc`
//!   answers NULL as for the per-uid limit, so `lf_advlock` fails with `ENOLCK`, and
//!   `lf_split`, whose allocation the C never fails, panics.
//! - `LOCKF_DEBUG` is not configured: `lf_print`, `lf_printlist` and the `DPRINTF`/`LFPRINT`
//!   traces are compiled out, as in C.
