//! Kernel thread handling: `kern/kern_kthread.c`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/kern_kthread.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Status: `ported` (M5-b1: `kthread_create_deferred` and `kthread_run_deferred_queue`;
//! M5-b2: `kthread_create`; M6-b: `kthread_exit` over `exit1`; M11a: the kernel lock in
//! `kthread_create`).
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `kthread_create` returns the new thread (`Result<&Proc, Errno>`) instead of an `int`
//!   plus an out-pointer.
