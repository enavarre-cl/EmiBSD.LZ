/* <CODE> */
//! Interrupt maps: which CPU serves each of a device's interrupts (`kern/kern_intrmap.c`).
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/kern_intrmap.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! Adapted (upstream) from DragonFly BSD's `if_ringmap`, generalised for every kind of
//! device. The CPUs that may take interrupts can be a subset of all CPUs: one per core (a
//! CPU whose `ci_smt_id` is not 0 is a second hardware thread and is left out). That set is
//! built again whenever `ncpus` has changed since the last one, and shared by reference
//! count between the maps made from it. `intrmap_create` picks how many interrupts a device
//! gets (at most `maxintrs`, at most one per interrupt CPU) and a grid: the CPUs are cut into
//! groups of `grid` and unit `n` of a driver starts at group `n` (wrapping), so several
//! devices of one driver spread their rings over different CPUs.
//!
//! Its users are multi-queue drivers with MSI-X (vio's queues, M13); nothing calls it yet.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `__HAVE_CPU_TOPOLOGY` is defined on both machines; `ci->ci_smt_id` is
//!   `Cpu::ci_smt_id`, whose default is 0 (amd64's `cpu_topology` is not ported).
//! - `intrmap_create` returns `&'static Intrmap` (as `taskq_create` does) and
//!   `intrmap_destroy` is an `unsafe fn` taking it back; the C cannot fail (`M_WAITOK`), and
//!   a `None` from `malloc` panics as running out of `kmem_map` does.
//! - The body of `intrmap_create` after `intrmap_cpus_get` is `intrmap_create_cpus`, so the
//!   host tests can give it an interrupt CPU set of any size.
//! - `1 << (fls(nintrs) - 1)` (`libkern/fls.c`, not ported) is `1 << nintrs.ilog2()`;
//!   `nintrs` is never 0 there.
//! - `KASSERTMSG` is `kassert!` (the message is the C's comment at the site).
