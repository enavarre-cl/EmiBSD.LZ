/* <CODE> */
//! Autoconfiguration subroutines: `kern/subr_autoconf.c`, see `autoconf(9)`,
//! `config_attach(9)`, `config_defer(9)`, `config_found(9)`, `device_lookup(9)`.
//!
//! Upstream: sys/kern/subr_autoconf.c @ 3ce1f3f79392
//!
//! A bus driver's attach function describes each device it finds in an attach-arguments
//! structure and calls `config_found`; `config_search` walks `cfdata[]` for the entries whose
//! parents include the bus, runs their match functions and keeps the best; `config_attach`
//! makes the softc, names it (`dv_xname`), files it in `alldevs` and the driver's `cd_devs`,
//! prints `"<name> at <parent>"` and calls the driver's attach function. The machine starts it
//! all with `config_rootfound("mainbus", ...)` from `cpu_configure`.
//!
//! ## Deviations
//! - `cfdata[]`, `cfroots[]` and `mainbus_cd` come from the machine
//!   (`machine::autoconf`, written by hand in `sys/arch/<arch>/conf/ioconf.rs` instead of by
//!   `config(8)`); `device_register` is the machine's too, as in C.
//! - `config_attach` tells a preallocated softc from a `cfdata` by the [`CfMatch`] it is given
//!   instead of by the parent's `CD_INDIRECT`, which is what produced that variant.
//! - Devices are `NonNull<Device>` where the C may free them (`config_attach`'s result,
//!   `config_detach`, `device_unref`, `device_lookup`), so no reference outlives the softc;
//!   `config_detach` and `device_unref` are `unsafe` for that reason.
//! - `config_detach`'s last loop in C leaves `cf` at `cfdata[]`'s terminating entry and then
//!   writes `cf->cf_unit = 0` into it when the driver has no units left, a store nothing reads;
//!   without a terminating entry the store is not made.
//! - `hotplug(4)` is in both GENERICs (`NHOTPLUG > 0`) but `dev/hotplug.c` is not ported:
//!   `hotplug_device_attach`/`hotplug_device_detach` are reported when not `cold`.
//! - `NMPATH` is 0: `mpath(4)` is not in the machines' `ioconf.rs` (`scsi/mpath.c` is not
//!   ported), so `device_mpath` returns `None`, as the C compiles it with a count of 0.
//! - `config_mountroot` sees no root vnode (`rootvp`; there is no VFS until M10), so it always
//!   queues the function for `config_process_deferred_mountroot`, as the C does before the
//!   root is mounted.
//! - `autoconf_verbose` starts at 0 (`AUTOCONF_VERBOSE`, a kernel option not configured).
